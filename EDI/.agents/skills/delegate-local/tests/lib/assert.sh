# Shared test helpers (#561), sourced by a tests/test-*.sh file as
#   . "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/assert.sh"
# and adopted file by file as each one is touched. It sets REPO, SAFE_PATH and
# the pass/fail counters, defines the asserts and the footer, and pins HOME to
# an empty temp dir, so a developer's ~/.local/share/delegate-local
# (config.sh, profile.sh, metrics.jsonl) can neither leak into a test nor be
# written by one. TMPDIR moves under the same dir, so every mktemp a test
# makes, and the drafts/ dir delegate.sh writes beside a mktemp'd metrics
# file, go when the file exits instead of piling up in the system temp dir.
# Not a test file itself: the CI matrix runs tests/test-*.sh.
