# PostToolUse hook (Bash matcher): confirms that a boundary credit was spent
# (#497). delegate-boundary-hook.sh spends a delegation credit at PreToolUse
# time, before the harness has decided whether the call runs: the worktree
# guard refuses it after that hook, or git fails on an empty index, and the
# retry found the credit gone. PostToolUse fires only when the tool ran and
# succeeded (a non-zero exit fires PostToolUseFailure; a permission denial
# fires nothing after PreToolUse), so this is the one place the outcome is
# known. It removes the pending marker the boundary hook left for this call,
# matched by tool_use_id so no other call can confirm it, and creates a
# per-session file that tells the boundary hook a confirmation can be
# expected at all. It is also the only place a credited post's body, inline
# or file-backed, is stored as the shipped final (#587), since only now is it
# known to have been posted. Fails OPEN: any error exits 0 with no output. Install is
# opt-in, beside the boundary hook — see docs/boundary-hook.md.
