# PreToolUse hook (Bash matcher): the trigger-rate boundary sensor (#277).
# The highest-volume delegation triggers (commit message, PR body, reply) are
# turn-medial, where SKILL.md text cannot reach them; a hook fires at the
# missed site. On every Bash call it classifies the leading tokens of each
# shell segment (never the raw string, so text ABOUT a boundary cannot fire),
# looks for a matching delegate.sh row in the window, logs one
# source:"opportunity" row, and when none is found nudges with the exact
# recipe, denying the proven boundaries until a delegation exists (#483). A
# credited post leaves a marker that delegate-boundary-confirm-hook.sh
# (PostToolUse) clears once the call has run, so a refused or failed post can
# be retried on the same credit (#497).
# Fails OPEN: any error, missing jq, no reachable provider, two consecutive
# denials, unwritable metrics or an untakeable lock all fall back to warn,
# with the reason recorded as enforce_skipped. Install is opt-in — see
# docs/boundary-hook.md.

# `target` was set by read_posted_body from the tokenizer's words for the
# matched segment: a gh/glab post's positional selector (number, URL, branch,
# tag or `gh api` endpoint), its --repo and its thread-picking `gh api`
# fields; never a body, file or title value or an env assignment. A commit
# names none, so its target is its project alone. A pending marker is the
# retry of the post that left it, so it is reused only for the same target.

# --- #465: a body file is NOT evidence the drafting moment passed ---------
# The hook cannot tell a pre-existing body file from one the agent wrote a
# call earlier, so every boundary is counted the same way.

# --- was there a local delegation for THIS boundary's recipe, recently? ----
# Recipe-aware: only a delegation whose recipe matches counts, else a
# commit-message delegation credits a later `gh pr create`. A bare (no-recipe)
# delegation credits nothing. Runs for file-backed bodies too:
# delegate-then-save-then-post is the workflow the nudge asks for.

  # --- an unconfirmed spend is not a spend (#497) ---------------------------
  # The credit is spent here, before the harness has decided whether the call
  # runs: the worktree guard refuses it after this hook, or git fails on an
  # empty index, and the retry found the credit gone. A credited post leaves a
  # marker that the PostToolUse confirm hook removes when the call ran and
  # succeeded (a failure fires PostToolUseFailure, a denial fires nothing). A
  # marker still there when this session reaches the same boundary again
  # inside the window is a post that did not happen, and this call is it:
  # credited on the same delegation, no second row, the final captured if the
  # first attempt could not. It outranks a fresh credit, else a sweep whose
  # refused post was retried after its next delegation would spend that one
  # and be denied on the post it was for. Honoured only once the confirm hook
  # has been seen in this session: a PreToolUse-only install never confirms,
  # and an unconfirmed marker would credit every post after the first. And
  # only for the project the refused post recorded, since the credit it
  # holds and the draft its final would be filed under are that project's:
  # the file is keyed by it too, so a credited post in another repository
  # does not overwrite it. The name is a basename or DELEGATE_PROJECT, so it
  # is reduced to a safe charset for the filename; a collision only makes the
  # stored project mismatch, which denies as before. And only for the same
  # target (#563): a refused reply to PR 12 that was never retried is not
  # the retry of a later reply to PR 13, which must earn a credit of its own.
  #
  # One marker PER CALL, `<prefix>.<tool_use_id>` (#587): parallel subagents
  # share a session id, and a single marker per session and boundary let a
  # second call in flight overwrite the first's, so the first confirmation
  # matched nothing and its final was lost. The hook cannot tell a refused
  # call from one still running, so the oldest unconfirmed marker in the
  # window is still taken as the one this call retries, but it is CLAIMED,
  # not deleted: renamed to `.superseded` with this call's would-be row
  # beside it as `.row`. The rename is the arbiter against the confirm hook,
  # which renames a marker before acting on it, so exactly one side wins. If
  # the claimed call does confirm later, it ran, so this call was not its
  # retry: the confirm hook stores its final and appends the `.row`, and the
  # post is counted after all, credited if a fresh credit stood behind it.
  # No final is written before a call runs, inline or file-backed, so a
