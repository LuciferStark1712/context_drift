# Stream the delegate metrics JSONL into Loki, one log line per row stamped at
# the row's own `ts`, so the Grafana dashboards can chart the FULL history.
# Tempo cannot: it indexes by ingestion time, so backfilled spans are
# unreachable at their real time. Idempotent via a line-offset watermark (the
# JSONL is append-only), so it is safe to schedule; `--full` re-pushes every
# row, and Loki de-duplicates identical (timestamp, line) entries per stream.
#
# Usage:
#   sync-metrics-to-loki.sh [--full] [--dry-run] [--metrics-file PATH]
#                           [--loki-url URL] [--state-file PATH]
#
# Env (overridden by the matching flags):
#   DELEGATE_LOKI_URL        Loki base URL (default http://localhost:3100)
#   DELEGATE_LOCAL_DATA_DIR  per-user data (default ~/.local/share/delegate-local)
#   DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE    metrics JSONL (default <data dir>/metrics.jsonl)
#   DELEGATE_LOKI_STATE      watermark file (default <metrics-file>.loki-sync;
#                            --state-file wins over it)
#   DELEGATE_LOKI_TIMEOUT    curl --max-time on the push (default 30)
#
# Exit: 0 on success (including "nothing new to push"), 2 on usage error,
#       1 on missing metrics file / jq / curl, or a failed push.

# One stream per `source` label; each value is [<ns timestamp string>, <row>].
# The ns timestamp is built as a STRING: 1.7e18 exceeds float64 exact-integer
# range. The JSONL ts is second-granular and Loki drops entries that collide
# on (stream, timestamp), so the 9 sub-second digits are a CONTENT hash of the
# row: content-derived, not line-derived, so a row re-pushed at a different
# file position dedups instead of duplicating (a line-number scheme doubled
# the feedback rows once). Feedback rows are enriched with the parent's
# recipe, tier and estimated_tokens_avoided from a map over the WHOLE file,
# since the parent may pre-date the watermark; the tokens let the calibration
# dashboard split tokens avoided by verdict, which LogQL cannot join. The map
# is keyed by the parent's otel_span_id ("id:") and its ts ("ts:"), and a
# feedback row looks up its ref_id first, so two parents in one second no
# longer enrich from the same row; ref_ts is the fallback for rows that
# pre-date ref_id. The source JSONL is left untouched. Enrichment feeds the
# content hash below, so changing it re-stamps already-synced feedback rows:
# wipe the Loki volume and re-sync with --full, or they are stored twice.
# Every pass reads the file line by line through `fromjson?`, never a slurp,
# so one malformed line anywhere is skipped instead of failing every run.

# A delegation can carry more than one verdict (a re-recorded one, or one

# taken back when a later one arrives; the first is stable. A verdict names its
