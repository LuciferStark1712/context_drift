#!/usr/bin/env bash
# replay-recipe.sh — the offline half of the replay gate (ADR 0031 as amended
# 2026-09-19; the procedure is docs/self-improvement-loop.md). Re-renders a
# recipe's stored cases under the champion template (the one that is live)
# and a candidate (the edit), sends both through delegate.sh itself so the
# checks, the retry and the envelope are production's, scores each output
# against what the caller supplied and what actually shipped, and reports
# per-case wins, losses and ties with a one-sided sign test. Greedy decoding
# is deterministic on this backend (ADR 0018, ADR 0031), so one pass per arm
# is the measurement, and a case whose two outputs differ is a decision
# rather than a sample: the online read needs ~134 verdicts per arm to see a
# fifteen-point lift, the paired read reaches p < 0.05 at six wins to none.
#
# A case is a recipe delegation with its structured inputs stored
# (`inputs_file`), a verdict, and a reference for the shipped text: the
# `final_file` a rejection stored, or the draft itself when the verdict was
# kept. Kept cases are the regression guard — a candidate that changes an
# output the agent shipped unedited has to answer for it, so every anchor
# the output carries that the reference does not counts against it, whether
# the inputs supplied it (`over`) or not (`invented`). The two are kept
# apart because they name different defects: on 2026-09-20 six rejected
# maintainer-review-reply drafts scored a perfect zero under the five
# measures that then existed (checks, dropped, invented, echoed, shape)
# while carrying 40-100% of the facts' anchors against shipped replies
# carrying a median 6%, the restatement the maintainer had rejected them
# for. `length` came with `over`, because an unbounded charge for carrying
# anchors past an anchor-poor reference rewards an output that carries
# nothing, and only its length says so.
#
# Usage:
#   replay-recipe.sh --recipe NAME [--candidate DIR] [--champion DIR]
#                    [--limit N] [--seed FILE] [--out DIR]
#
#   --recipe NAME     recipe to replay (required)
#   --candidate DIR   prompts directory holding the edited NAME.md; without
#                     one the champion alone is scored (a baseline read)
#   --champion DIR    the live prompts directory. Default: the recipe as
#                     committed on `main` (DELEGATE_REPLAY_BASE overrides the
#                     ref), materialised in a temp dir, so an edit made on a
#                     branch in this same checkout is compared against what is
#                     live rather than against itself; when git cannot show it,
#                     DELEGATE_PROMPTS_DIR, else this checkout's prompts/
#   --limit N         newest N cases (default 40)
#   --seed FILE       JSON array of extra cases {id, ts, recipe, tier, stdin,
#                     vars, draft, final, verdict, model}; one without a final
#                     is skipped, one whose id the corpus already has is
#                     skipped, ids are [A-Za-z0-9_-]+
#   --out DIR         per-arm output cache (default <data dir>/replay); an
#                     output is keyed by case, template hash and model, so a
#                     second run against the same candidate sends nothing.
#                     Written under umask 077 and pruned on the same
