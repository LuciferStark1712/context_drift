# Append a hit/miss/scaffold feedback row to the delegate metrics JSONL,
# referencing the `source:"delegate"` row pinned by `--id <otel_span_id>` (or
# `--ts`), or the one row inside the freshness window when no pin is given.
# Feedback rows are keyed by `ref_ts` (and `ref_id`) to the row they judge and
# `metrics-summary.sh` joins them at read time. Every row carries
# verdict_source:"agent", the one verdict tier (ADR 0030). A row with a

                           [--final <path>|-] hit|miss|scaffold [reason words...]
  hit = output kept as-is; miss = rewritten or discarded; scaffold =
  edited and shipped. scaffold is recorded distinct from both and never fires the
  MISS-recurrence nudge. A miss or scaffold REQUIRES a reason: the agent
  recording its own just-finished delegation always knows why it rewrote the
  draft, and a rejection with no reason counts in every denominator while
  telling the loop nothing.
  --id pins the verdict to one delegate row by its otel_span_id — the value
  delegate.sh prints on its delegate-meta line as id="..." and in the
  verdict nudge. It is the only pin that cannot name two rows: ts has
  second precision and parallel delegations share it, so --ts (kept for
  older callers) refuses when more than one row carries that second.
  Without a pin, the verdict attaches to the one delegate row inside the
  freshness window (default 300 s); with parallel sessions "most recent" is
  routinely someone else's, so two fresh rows refuse and list the
  candidates with their ids, and none refuses as stale. The verdict's
  project is copied from the row it references.
  --source agent is the default and the only value: the agent that used or
  rewrote the draft records the verdict (ADR 0030). The flag is accepted so
  existing callers keep working; --source human is refused, because that
  tier was retired.
  --final stores the text that ACTUALLY shipped (a file path, or - for
  stdin) beside the captured draft, so a MISS carries the concrete
  (generated, shipped) pair instead of only a prose description of the
  difference. This is the signal recipe edits are calibrated from.
  All three flags may appear anywhere on the line, including after the
  reason words. Put `--` before the verdict when the reason itself needs
  to name a flag, e.g. `-- miss "the nudge should say --final"`.

Consider filing a prompt-pattern issue so the recipe library tracks the gap:
  gh issue create --repo ${github_repo} \\
    --label prompt-pattern \\
    --title "<recipe-name>: <one-line pattern summary>" \\
    --body "See .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/prompt-pattern.md — paste the matched MISS reasons above, the prompt, the model output, and a suggested fix if known."
Silence this nudge for one call with DELEGATE_FEEDBACK_NO_NUDGE=1.
