# Stop hook: the backstop for verdicts the agent did not record inline. The
# agent that used or rewrote a draft is the only judge there is (ADR 0030),
# and it knows only while it is still running; a Stop fires while it is
# alive with the turn's work done. The hook lists this session's untracked
# successful delegations ONCE and returns {"decision":"block",...}, which is
# what re-engages a stopping agent (additionalContext does not). A marker
# keyed by session_id stops the re-inject looping when the agent declines.
# There is no enforce mode: a forced verdict is not a fact. Fails OPEN: any
# error, missing jq or an unwritable marker exits 0 without injecting.

delegate-local verdict sweep: ${count} delegation(s) from this session produced output but carry no verdict. Before you stop, record for each one whether you USED the delegated output as-is (hit), edited it and shipped it (scaffold), or rewrote/discarded it (miss) — a fact about what you did. scaffold and miss need a reason, and --final <path|-> naming what you shipped instead:

${batch}

Run one of these per row, with <pin> replaced by the --id or --ts shown on its line:
  DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE="${metrics_file}" bash "${script_dir}/delegate-feedback.sh" <pin> --source agent hit                  # shipped as-is
  DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE="${metrics_file}" bash "${script_dir}/delegate-feedback.sh" <pin> --source agent scaffold "<reason>"  # edited and shipped
  DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE="${metrics_file}" bash "${script_dir}/delegate-feedback.sh" <pin> --source agent miss "<reason>"      # thrown away

This prompt is shown once per session; recording what you can and then stopping is fine. Set DELEGATE_VERDICT_STOP_MODE=off to silence.
