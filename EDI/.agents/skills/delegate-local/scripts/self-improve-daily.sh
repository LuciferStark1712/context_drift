#!/usr/bin/env bash
# self-improve-daily.sh — the scheduled runner for the daily calibration pass
# (#558, docs/self-improvement-loop.md "Run it on a schedule"). launchd starts
# it once a day; a session-bound cron dies with its session, which left the
# watermark at 2026-09-22 for over a week.
#
# It runs the gate with --peek. Exit 10 (nothing new) is a quiet, successful
# run and no model is called. Otherwise it starts one headless `claude -p`
# session in a detached worktree of this clone at origin/main, with the
# evidence bundle on stdin and a narrow tool allowlist, and advances the
# watermark to the bundle's "Newest row" only when that session exits 0, so
# a failed session leaves the window for the next day. Rows appended while
# the session runs (its own commit and PR delegations) stay after the
# watermark and reach the next bundle.
#
# Run it from the live clone (~/.local/share/delegate-local-live), never from
# a dev checkout: the gate and the worktree both come from the clone this
# script sits in.
#
# Env:
#   DELEGATE_LOCAL_DATA_DIR      data dir (default ~/.local/share/delegate-local);
#                                the log, lock and worktree live here
#   DELEGATE_SELF_IMPROVE_STATE  watermark file (default <data dir>/self-improve.state),
#                                the same one self-improve.sh reads
# Exit: 0 quiet, done, or another run holds the lock; 1 the session failed;
#       2 setup or gate error. Everything goes to <data dir>/self-improve-daily.log.

prompt="You are the scheduled daily self-improvement pass for delegate-local, running headless with nobody watching.
Read docs/self-improvement-loop.md and follow it from \"What the bundle gives you\" to the end. The gate has already run with --peek and its evidence bundle is on stdin; do not run scripts/self-improve.sh without --peek, because this runner advances the watermark when you exit successfully.
Choose at most one fix. You may edit prompts/ and docs/calibration/; if the replay rejects your edit, revert it and make the fix a dated entry in docs/calibration/<recipe>.md recording the attempt and its replay lines. If you make one, create a branch named loop/$today-<short-slug> from this detached checkout, commit, push that branch with 'git push -u origin loop/$today-<slug>', and open a PR against main with 'gh pr create'. Draft commit and PR text with scripts/delegate.sh recipes and record each verdict with scripts/delegate-feedback.sh --id, as the repo's CLAUDE.md describes.
Never merge, never push to main, never publish or release anything.
End with one line: the PR URL, or why the evidence was too thin to change anything."

# The allowlist is only a boundary while nothing it runs can be rewritten:
# a script the session could edit and then run would carry any denied
# command past it. So edits are confined to prompts/ and docs/calibration/
# (a recipe and its dated calibration history, all the procedure changes; an
# Edit rule binds the Write tool too, and ../ is refused), the scripts and
# suites it may run live outside both, and the suites are named exactly. User
# settings are not loaded, so the profile's own allow rules cannot widen this
