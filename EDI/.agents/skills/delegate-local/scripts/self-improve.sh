# self-improve.sh — the gate and the evidence bundle for the recurring
# calibration session (docs/self-improvement-loop.md). It GATES (nothing new
# since the watermark: exit 10 and say nothing) and it BUNDLES the new
# verdicts, reasons, per-recipe keep rates, deterministic check failures and,
# where both were captured, a diff between the draft and the shipped text.
# The diff is the one objective part of a MISS: DROPPED names the tokens the
# human had to put back, which is what a calibrated recipe edit aims at. Where
# the rendered input was stored too (#516), the pair is scored against what
# the caller supplied: DROPPED narrows to supplied anchors and ADDED takes
# the ones nobody supplied, UNUSED names the supplied anchors the shipped
# text left out, ECHOED the supplied sentences the draft handed back.
#
# Usage:
#   self-improve.sh [--file PATH] [--peek] [--min-delegations N] [--days N]
#   self-improve.sh --quarantine [--peek] [--file PATH]
#   self-improve.sh --ritual [--since YYYY-MM-DD] [--file PATH]
#
#   --quarantine       scan the stored finals and list the suspect ones in
#                      suspect-finals.tsv beside the metrics file (#587): an
#                      empty final, one byte-identical to an earlier stem's,
#                      or one closer to a neighbouring draft (same recipe,
#                      project and session) than its own. The bundle and replay-recipe.sh
#                      skip the listed pairs; nothing is deleted. With --peek
#                      the list is printed and no sidecar is written.
#   --ritual           the backfill (#588): per recipe and template, the
#                      rejections whose shipped final was already in the
#                      piped stdin, from the stored final_preexisting or
#                      measured now for a verdict recorded before it; with
#                      --since, delegations on or after that date only. The
#                      measured ritual verdicts go to ritual-verdicts.tsv
#                      beside the metrics file, merged with what it already
#                      held (pruned files cannot be measured again), which
#                      every rate here and in
#                      metrics-summary.sh reads (#564); with --peek nothing
#                      is written. Never the watermark or a metrics row.
#   --peek            report without advancing the watermark
#   --min-delegations  new delegations needed before there is anything to
#                      report (default 1)
#   --days N           rolling window for the per-recipe section (default 7);
#                      the since-watermark sections are unaffected
