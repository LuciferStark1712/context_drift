# delegate-local

An agent skill that routes summarisation, triage, and bulk-text tasks to locally-installed models (Ollama or MLX) instead of the cloud API. Keeps content on-device, preserves the agent's context window, and uses `llmfit` to keep the model set current.

## 30-second quickstart

One linear path from nothing to a first delegated call:

```bash
# 1. Install the whole skill (SKILL.md + scripts/) into Claude Code, user-scoped
npx skills add IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local -a claude-code -g

# 2. Confirm at least one local model is installed and see how tiers route
bash ~/.claude/skills/delegate-local/scripts/audit-models.sh

# 3. (optional) Personalise commit style to this machine: it derives a
#    profile from your own git history, has you confirm or edit each value, and
#    writes nothing without confirmation. Run it from a repo that reflects your style.
bash ~/.claude/skills/delegate-local/scripts/onboard.sh

# 4. Make your first delegated call
git diff | bash ~/.claude/skills/delegate-local/scripts/delegate.sh prose "Summarise this diff in 3 bullets."
```

Step 2 requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (or [`mlx-lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) on Apple Silicon) with a model pulled — see [Requirements](#requirements) and [Backends](#backends). Step 3 is optional but recommended on a new machine; the rest of this README covers install options, backend selection, and the routing internals. After install, the skill auto-delegates matching tasks inside your agent — the raw `delegate.sh` call in step 4 is just to confirm the backend works end-to-end.

## What it does

When a task fits the "gather context once, send one prompt, return text" pattern — log and PR/issue summarisation, commit-message and changelog drafting, batch triage and classification, structured field extraction, and prose rewriting — the agent delegates to a local model via `delegate.sh` instead of handling it itself. Reasoning, tool-calling, and repo-wide tasks still go to the cloud model.

The skill auto-delegates by default. Saying "delegate where it fits" or "auto-delegate" once locks that behaviour for the rest of the conversation.

Core pattern (from [local-brain](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/local-brain)) — resolve a tier to the best installed model, pipe context in, get text back:

```bash
git diff HEAD~5 | bash scripts/delegate.sh prose "Summarise in 3 bullets."
```

`delegate.sh` handles backend selection (Ollama or MLX via auto-probe), model resolution, metrics logging, and returns clean text with no ANSI artifacts.

## Requirements

- At least one OpenAI-compatible model server running locally: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with a model pulled, [`mlx-lm`](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm) on Apple Silicon, or Docker Model Runner (see [Providers](#providers) below)
- `jq` (for `audit-models.sh`)
- `llmfit` (optional, enables upgrade suggestions based on your hardware)

## Providers

Every call goes to an OpenAI-compatible `POST {base}/chat/completions`. `DELEGATE_BASE_URL` is an ordered list of base URLs, and the first provider that is both reachable and serving a model the tier prefers takes the call. The default list is built from the host variables, so a non-default port or a remote daemon keeps working:

```
${MLX_HOST:-http://localhost:8080}/v1
${DOCKER_MODEL_HOST:-http://localhost:12434}/engines/v1
${OLLAMA_HOST:-http://localhost:11434}/v1
```

MLX leads because [ADR 0022](docs/adr/0022-mlx-primary-backend-rationale.md) measured it at roughly an order of magnitude lower latency than Ollama on identical weights. A provider that is down costs one refused connection and is skipped; a host running only Ollama routes there with no configuration.

On Apple Silicon, MLX is the recommended provider. Install and auto-start via launchd are documented in [docs/install-mlx.md](docs/install-mlx.md). The quick version:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/venvs/mlx-lm && ~/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/pip install mlx-lm
~/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit
~/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit --port 8080 &
```

Pin a single provider by setting `DELEGATE_BASE_URL` yourself, for example `DELEGATE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1`. The metrics JSONL tags each call with a `backend` field derived from the winning URL (`mlx` / `docker` / `ollama`, else `host:port`) so `scripts/metrics-summary.sh` can break down latency per provider.

## Install

### Universal (recommended)

Use [Vercel Labs' `skills` CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills). It clones the repo and installs the whole skill directory — `SKILL.md` plus `scripts/`, `prompts/`, and `docs/` — into every detected agent tool (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Copilot, and many others) at once, so the `scripts/…` commands below work straight after install and updates propagate everywhere:

```bash
npx skills add IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local
```

Pass `-g` to install user-scoped (`~/<agent>/skills/`) instead of per-project, `--copy` to make independent copies on systems without symlink support, or `-a claude-code` to limit to a specific agent.

### Per-tool guides

When the universal install is the wrong fit (per-machine routing, MCP-only consumers), the per-tool docs cover the specifics:

- [Claude Code](docs/install-claude-code.md)
- [Codex](docs/install-codex.md)
- [OpenCode](docs/install-opencode.md)
- [MLX backend (Apple Silicon, optional)](docs/install-mlx.md)

### Manual copy

The skill is conformant with the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) — `SKILL.md` at the directory root with `name` and `description` frontmatter — so any tool that reads that format can use it. To install without the `skills` CLI, clone the repo and drop the directory into the tool's expected skills path:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local
cp -r delegate-local ~/.claude/skills/   # or your tool's skills dir
```

### Confirm routing

After install, run the audit from wherever the skill landed:

```bash
bash <install-path>/scripts/audit-models.sh
```

### Personalising routing (recommended)

The shipped `pick-model.sh` is one preference list for everyone. To override the order on a specific machine without forking the repo, drop a bash file at `~/.local/share/delegate-local/config.sh`. `pick-model.sh` sources it after the shipped defaults are set, so any tier the file touches wins. Untouched tiers fall through to shipped defaults; an absent file changes nothing.

> **Trust note:** `config.sh` is sourced as bash by `pick-model.sh` (and `profile.sh` by `load-flavor.sh`), meaning their contents execute with your environment and privileges. This is arbitrary code execution by design, similar to `~/.aiderrc` or `~/.claude/settings.local.json`. Only place a `config.sh` or `profile.sh` you wrote yourself or fully trust at those paths; never paste one from an untrusted source. `load-flavor.sh` additionally skips a profile that isn't owned by you or is group/world-writable. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full trust model.

```bash
# ~/.local/share/delegate-local/config.sh
case "$tier" in
  prose) prefs=("gemma4" "qwen3.6" "qwen3-next") ;;
esac
```

Nothing generates `config.sh`: write it by hand, and only for a tier whose shipped order is wrong for you. (`scripts/init.sh` used to print one, but its output was the shipped order with the installed models moved first, which `pick-model.sh` already does, and once installed it shadowed every later change to the shipped lists; it was removed in #567.)

Recommended first step on any new machine or user: the onboarding wizard derives your commit-style flavor from your own git history (`derive-flavor.sh`), presents each value for confirm-or-edit, and writes the profile only on explicit confirmation (timestamped `.bak` before any overwrite). Run it from a repo whose history reflects your style:

```bash
bash <install-path>/scripts/onboard.sh
```

Without a terminal it degrades to print-only and writes nothing. The probe also works standalone — it is read-only and prints to stdout, never auto-writes:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/delegate-local
bash <install-path>/scripts/derive-flavor.sh > ~/.local/share/delegate-local/profile.sh
```

Set `DELEGATE_LOCAL_CONFIG=/some/other/path.sh` to redirect the routing-override path `pick-model.sh` reads, and `DELEGATE_LOCAL_PROFILE=/some/other/profile.sh` to redirect the flavor-profile path `onboard.sh` and `load-flavor.sh` use (useful for testing or per-project overrides).

## Where per-user data lives

Metrics, the routing override and the flavour profile live in a data directory,
not inside the installed skill:

```
~/.local/share/delegate-local/
  metrics.jsonl        every call, one JSON line
  metrics.loki-sync    Loki watermark, if you use the sync job
  config.sh            routing override
  profile.sh           flavour profile
```

They used to default to `~/.claude/skills/delegate-local/`, which is the
directory the skill installer owns, so `npx skills add ... update` could delete
your accumulated calibration history.

Resolution per file, highest first: the file-specific variable
(`DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE`, `DELEGATE_LOCAL_CONFIG`, `DELEGATE_LOCAL_PROFILE`),
then `DELEGATE_LOCAL_DATA_DIR`, then the default above. `XDG_DATA_HOME` is
deliberately not consulted: it is commonly set in a shell rc file and absent in
GUI-launched processes, so honouring it would make a verdict recorded in your
terminal attach to a different metrics file than one recorded by an agent.

### Moving an existing install

```bash
bash <install-path>/scripts/onboard.sh --migrate-data
```

It copies, never moves, so it cannot destroy anything, and it refuses to
overwrite a target that already exists with different content.

If you also plan to stop symlinking the skill at a dev checkout, the order
matters and the wrong one fails silently:

1. migrate the data
2. verify with `metrics-summary.sh` that the totals match
3. prune any stale git worktrees holding older copies of the scripts
4. repoint the skill symlink **last**

Repointing before migrating leaves the history stranded where nothing can read
it, and the migration then reports success having copied nothing.

The maintainer's own machine now points both profiles' skill symlinks at a
separate clone of `origin/main` rather than the dev checkout, updated after
each merge with `git -C ~/.local/share/delegate-local-live pull --ff-only`; `CLAUDE.md` describes the arrangement.


## Forking / adopting this skill

The mechanisms are fork-friendly out of the box — routing, metrics, and the feedback loop are all driven by env vars and the per-user `config.sh` above. What needs repointing is a handful of author-specific defaults:

1. **Run the onboarding wizard.** First step on any new machine or user (see [Personalising routing](#personalising-routing-recommended)) — it derives your commit-style flavor profile from your own git history and offers to install the delegate hooks:

   ```bash
   bash <install-path>/scripts/onboard.sh
   ```

2. **Repoint the author-specific defaults** via env vars where they don't suit you:

   | Variable | Default | What it repoints |
   |----------|---------|------------------|
   | `DELEGATE_GITHUB_REPO` | `IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local` | Repo targeted by the drafted `gh issue create` command (`delegate-feedback.sh`) |
   | `DELEGATE_CONTENT_ALLOW_ORG` | `IsmaelMartinez` | GitHub org/user allowed by the content-scan URL allowlist (`validate-skill-content.sh`) |
   | `DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE` | `~/.local/share/delegate-local/metrics.jsonl` | Metrics JSONL location |
   | `DELEGATE_PROMPTS_DIR` | `<install-path>/prompts` | Recipe directory |
   | `OLLAMA_HOST` / `MLX_HOST` | `http://localhost:11434` / `http://localhost:8080` | Backend endpoints |

3. **Install from your fork** the same way as upstream:

   ```bash
   npx skills add <your-user>/delegate-local
   ```

4. **Re-calibrate triggering for your models.** `evals/eval-set.json` carries the trigger queries from the upstream project. Routing works without touching it, but a fork keeps the SKILL.md description calibrated by re-running the trigger eval against its own installed models:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/eval-skill-triggers.sh --local
   ```

5. **Update `CODEOWNERS`** to point `*` at your own handle so review requests go to you, not the upstream author.

## Files

- `SKILL.md` — triggering description and usage patterns the agent reads.
- `scripts/delegate.sh <tier> "<prompt>"` (or `--recipe NAME ["<prompt>"]`, which takes its tier from the recipe and makes the prompt optional) — wraps `pick-model.sh` + the backend's HTTP API (Ollama or MLX, auto-selected) with `think:false` and `temperature:0` defaults. Appends one JSON line per call to `~/.local/share/delegate-local/metrics.jsonl`. Use this instead of bare `ollama run` or hand-rolled `curl` calls.
- `scripts/pick-model.sh <tier>` — resolves a tier to the best installed model via substring preference lists. Tiers are `code`, `prose`, `reasoning`, and `long-context` (active), plus `vision`, `embedding`, `premium-general`, and `reasoning-vision` (scaffolded). Edit this file (not the skill body) when your installed set changes.
- `scripts/audit-models.sh` — prints installed models, tier routing, and llmfit-driven upgrade suggestions filtered to first-party providers. Read-only; never pulls.
- `scripts/metrics-summary.sh` — reads the metrics JSONL and prints volume per tier, p50/p95 latency, total tokens-avoided, top models by frequency, and per-project / per-recipe hit-rate. Pass `--since YYYY-MM-DD` or `--days N` to window every section to recent rows. Read-only.
- `scripts/delegate-feedback.sh [--id <id>|--ts <iso8601>] [--final <path|->] <verdict>`, where the verdict is `hit`, `scaffold "<reason>"` or `miss "<reason>"` — records whether you used a delegation's output as-is (hit), rewrote or discarded it (miss), or edited it and shipped it (scaffold), appending a `feedback` row to the metrics JSONL. The reason is required on scaffold and miss and the call exits 2 without one; every row carries `verdict_source:"agent"`, the one verdict tier (ADR 0030). `--id` pins the verdict to the row whose `otel_span_id` the `delegate-meta:` line printed as `id="..."` (the nudge already carries it); without a pin the verdict attaches to the one delegate row inside the last 5 minutes and refuses when there are several, since parallel sessions delegate seconds apart (#474). This is the calibration signal `metrics-summary.sh` rolls up. `--final` stores the text that actually shipped beside the draft `delegate.sh` already captured, which is what turns a rejection from a prose description into a diffable pair (ADR 0029). Flags may appear anywhere on the line, including after the reason; `--` before the verdict ends flag parsing so a reason can name one verbatim. When the boundary hook has already stored what a credited post sent, the verdict adopts it without `--final` and records `final_source:"posted"`.
- `scripts/self-improve.sh` — the gate and evidence bundle for the recurring calibration session. Exits 10 in silence when nothing has been delegated since its watermark, and 0 with the bundle when something has: verdict tally, per-recipe keep rates worst-first, clustered deterministic check failures, and for every rejection the reason plus, where the pair was captured, `DROPPED` (anchors the human had to put back), `INVENTED` (values the model made up, where the human put something in their place) or `CUT` (material removed, where they put nothing back), and `SHAPE` (list where prose shipped). A recipe that ran under more than one template in the window gets a per-template line, which is the post-merge read for an edit. The procedure a session follows is [`docs/self-improvement-loop.md`](docs/self-improvement-loop.md).
- `scripts/self-improve-daily.sh` — the launchd runner for that session: gates with `self-improve.sh --peek`, starts one headless `claude -p` pass with a narrow tool allowlist in a throwaway worktree when there is something new, and advances the watermark only when the pass succeeds. Maintainer tooling; the plist template and the install, check and stop commands are in [`docs/self-improvement-loop.md`](docs/self-improvement-loop.md#run-it-on-a-schedule).
- `scripts/replay-recipe.sh --recipe NAME --candidate DIR` — the offline gate for a recipe edit. Re-renders the recipe's stored cases (each recipe call stores its stdin, vars, tier and prompt as `<stem>.inputs.json`, and its row carries `template_sha`, a hash of the recipe's frontmatter and prompt block) under the live template (the recipe as committed on `main` by default, `--champion DIR` to override) and the candidate, sends both through `delegate.sh`, scores each output on failed checks, dropped supplied anchors, supplied anchors carried past what shipped (`over`, the facts handed back in new sentences), invented anchors, echoed sentences, list-vs-prose shape and a length flag (under a quarter or over four times what shipped) against what shipped, and prints `ACCEPT`, `REJECT` or `INCONCLUSIVE` from a one-sided sign test over per-case wins. Outputs are cached by case, template hash and model under the drafts' retention. Maintainer tooling, not a CI gate.
- `scripts/delegate-boundary-hook.sh` and `scripts/delegate-boundary-confirm-hook.sh` — the opt-in `PreToolUse` boundary hook that credits a commit, PR, issue or reply to a recorded delegation (denying the proven boundaries until one exists) and its `PostToolUse` companion that confirms the credit was spent only when the call actually ran, so a post the harness refused or that failed inside git can be retried on the same credit (#497). Install both; see [`docs/boundary-hook.md`](docs/boundary-hook.md).
- `scripts/delegate-verdict-stop-hook.sh` — opt-in `Stop` hook that hands the session's own untracked delegations back to the agent for a verdict before it stops. Not wired up by default; see [`docs/boundary-hook.md`](docs/boundary-hook.md) for the `settings.json` block, the session-once loop guard, and why there is no enforce mode.
- `docs/observability/` — opt-in OTLP exporter for visibility. Set `DELEGATE_OTEL_ENDPOINT=<url>` and every `delegate.sh` call POSTs an OTLP span (off by default, zero overhead when unset). Content is redacted by default; only metadata (tier, model, recipe, char counts, durations, verdict) travels to the collector. Three backends documented: [Grafana Cloud](docs/observability/grafana-cloud.md), [Langfuse](docs/observability/langfuse-self-host.md), and [Phoenix](docs/observability/phoenix.md). See [`docs/otel-schema.md`](docs/otel-schema.md) for the wire format. `scripts/sync-metrics-to-loki.sh` and `scripts/backfill-otel.sh` push the metrics JSONL to Loki / an OTLP collector for the Grafana dashboards under `dashboards/`; `scripts/observability-doctor.sh` diagnoses the setup.
- [`docs/env.md`](docs/env.md) — every `DELEGATE_*` environment variable the scripts read, with its default, effect and the script that reads it.
- `tests/` — unit tests for every script. Run with `bash tests/run-tests.sh` (and the per-script `bash tests/test-*.sh`).

## Troubleshooting

The wrapper's failure modes map onto its exit codes, and every hard failure prints recovery options on stderr.

Exit 1 (`pick-model failed for tier`) means no installed model matches the tier's preference list. Run `bash scripts/audit-models.sh` to see what is installed and how tiers currently route, then either pull a model from the tier's preference list in `scripts/pick-model.sh` or edit that list to match your hardware. `pick-model.sh` distinguishes the two causes: "no provider is reachable" means start a daemon, "no provider holds a model for tier X" means pull a model or edit the preference list.

Exit 3 (`pre-flight canary`) means the resolved model did not answer a 1-token probe within `DELEGATE_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT` (default 10 s). The stderr message distinguishes a cold-load timeout (retry with a larger timeout), a connection refusal (start the provider daemon — `mlx_lm.server`, Docker Model Runner or `ollama serve` — and confirm `MLX_HOST` / `DOCKER_MODEL_HOST` / `OLLAMA_HOST`, or the `DELEGATE_BASE_URL` you pinned), and an HTTP error (usually a bad model name).

A non-zero curl exit on the dispatch itself (commonly 7, connection refused) means the resolved provider went away between the canary and the full request, or no canary ran (bare non-recipe calls skip it). `bash scripts/pick-model.sh --print-providers` shows which URLs are in play; the same daemon/host checks apply.

Empty or whitespace-only output from an MLX model usually means a raw completions endpoint was hit instead of chat-completions — `delegate.sh` always uses the right one, so this points at a hand-rolled `curl` bypassing the wrapper.

If a failure persists after the suggested recovery, [file a bug](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) with the verbatim stderr and your `bash scripts/audit-models.sh` output. For quality problems (the model answered, but badly) use the hit/miss loop below instead — recurring misses graduate into [`prompt-pattern` issues](#calibration-feedback-loop), not bug reports.

## Validation

Three scripts gate every PR via GitHub Actions:

- `scripts/validate-frontmatter.sh SKILL.md` — asserts the SKILL.md frontmatter has required fields, the `name` matches the directory, and `name` matches the Claude Skills regex, and that `description` plus `when_to_use` stay within 1,536 characters, the point where Claude Code truncates them in the skill listing (#557), warning above the Agent Skills spec's 1,024.
- `scripts/validate-skill-content.sh SKILL.md` — scans for eight categories of dangerous content (auth-disable, permissive flags, credential exfiltration, base64 obfuscation, zero-width / bidi unicode, broad tool grants, unresolved merge markers, external URLs). Justified false positives go in `.content-check-allow`.
- `scripts/eval-skill-triggers.sh` — validates `evals/eval-set.json` shape by default; with `--local [model]` sends the whole eval set as one batched call to a local provider from `DELEGATE_BASE_URL` (free, on-device; defaults to `pick-model.sh code`) with thinking off unless `DELEGATE_THINK=true`, as `delegate.sh` sends it; with `--api` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, runs against Claude. Both modes use only the SKILL.md frontmatter description as the trigger surface and assert recall + negative-precision thresholds.

The `--local` mode is the recommended pre-merge gate (10–30 s on a mid-tier machine, dogfoods the project's own routing). The `--api` mode is the CI gate: it runs, and fails the job when it cannot produce a score, whenever a PR changes `SKILL.md` or `evals/` and the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret is set (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions); without the secret the CI step prints a notice and skips.

The eval set holds 22 gating positive queries (tagged exact or paraphrase), 4 non-gating diagnostic ones (embedded) and 15 negatives (adjacent or unrelated), scored against the 0.9 recall and negative-precision thresholds inside the file. Batching sends every query in the set in one request rather than one request per query (#62), and it is more discriminating than per-query scoring on paraphrase-edge positives, so the model matters more and the passing set drifts as the eval set grows. Re-measured on 2026-06-21, `deepseek-r1:32b` and `qwen3-coder:30b-a3b-q8_0` both scored 1.000 / 1.000, `qwen3-coder-next:latest` (the `pick-model.sh code` default then) scraped a 0.909 pass, and `qwen3.6:35b-a3b-q8_0` dropped to 0.864 recall, below the gate; pass `--local deepseek-r1:32b` explicitly for a comfortable margin. The GitHub Models mode CI used to run was removed when the service was retired on 2026-07-30 (#548): its host answered every request with HTTP 200 and a plain-text `OK`, and the step's `continue-on-error` hid that for eight weeks, so a non-200 or a body that is not the expected JSON now prints the status and the start of the body and exits 2. The local `.claude/hooks/post-edit-validate.sh` runs the shape and content checks on save but not the trigger-accuracy gate.

## Calibration feedback loop

Recipes evolve from real session feedback. The loop is end-to-end on-device until you decide to share a finding:

```
delegate.sh run                metrics.jsonl                delegate-feedback.sh
  ↓                              (append-only,                miss "<reason>"
  appends one row                 gitignored)                   ↓

                                                                ↓

                                                                ↓
                                                          you decide whether to

```

The single-machine metrics JSONL has no scheduled job behind it; the nudge is the runtime signal. After the third similar MISS in the rolling window, `delegate-feedback.sh` prints the matched reasons and a draft `gh issue create` command pre-targeted at the `prompt-pattern` label. The nudge is advisory — it never opens the issue on its own — so each filing stays a deliberate call. Silence one invocation with `DELEGATE_FEEDBACK_NO_NUDGE=1`; tune the trigger via `DELEGATE_FEEDBACK_NUDGE_AT` (default 3), `DELEGATE_FEEDBACK_NUDGE_WINDOW_DAYS` (default 30), and `DELEGATE_FEEDBACK_SIMILAR_THRESHOLD` (default 0.4 Jaccard over stopword-stripped content tokens).

A `prompt-pattern` issue captures the task shape, tier and resolved model, verbatim prompt and model output, and (when known) the prompt that turned the MISS into a HIT. `prompts/README.md` documents how the maintainer graduates an issue into a `prompts/<new>.md` recipe paired with an `evals/eval-set.json` positive — closing the loop empirically rather than evaporating after one conversation.

## What you actually save

Worth being explicit about this because the skill could easily be oversold.

The delegated call is where the savings live — the local model writes the summary, classification, or patch instead of Claude. That's real and measurable: the metrics rollup (`scripts/metrics-summary.sh`) reports a "tokens avoided" headline computed from real Ollama `prompt_eval_count` + `eval_count` counts. The 2026-05-04 v8 probe's "~250× cheaper than Opus" number is also real for the specific workload it measured — 18 minimal-patch code cells scored by pytest.

But a realistic delegation flow costs more Anthropic tokens than just "the delegated call minus zero." In a typical turn, Claude still spends tokens to:

- read the user's request and decide a local model fits,
- frame the delegation prompt,
- read the local model's response back,
- verify the response against the actual files (for correctness-critical work — see SKILL.md's Discipline subsection on running the test when delegating code, and the gather-delegate-verify pattern throughout).

For small tasks — a 3-bullet diff summary, a one-line commit message — the verification overhead can eat most of the headline saving. The shape where this skill actually pays off is bulk or repeated work: triage 50 TODOs, classify 40 findings against an allowlist, draft release notes from a 200-line changelog. There the per-item Anthropic cost is dominated by the delegated generation, which is the part that moves to local.

Rough annual estimates (char-count tokens, ~1.5 KTok per round-trip that would otherwise go to the API):

| Usage profile                         | Delegations/year | Haiku-equiv save | Sonnet-equiv save | Opus-equiv save |
|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Subscription user (Claude Max/Pro)    | any              | $0 (marginal)    | $0                | $0              |
| Casual API user (~10/hour × 20 h/wk)  | ~10k             | $25–40           | $75–115           | $375–560        |
| Heavy/team (~500/day × every day)     | ~180k            | $450–700         | $1.4k–2k          | $6.8k–10k       |

The subscription row is the honest one for individual developers: inside a Claude Max or Pro plan the marginal API cost of a delegation is zero, so the direct-dollar saving is zero. The real benefit in that case is different: **context-window preservation** (those tokens don't bloat Claude's active context, so long conversations stay focused) and **privacy** (sensitive logs, configs, and credentials never leave the machine).

More capable local models will shift these numbers but probably not by an order of magnitude. "250× cheaper than Opus" is a headline for one measured shape, not a general claim.

## Design notes

The skill intentionally avoids frameworks. Local models are good summarisers and weak agents; delegation is a shell pipe, not an orchestration layer. The `pick-model.sh` preference lists are the single point of truth for routing — no hardcoded model names in the skill body.

`audit-models.sh` cross-checks llmfit's `installed` flag against the models the reachable providers serve (the same union `pick-model.sh --print-installed` reports, so MLX and Docker Model Runner count as much as Ollama) because llmfit tracks its own HuggingFace GGUF cache rather than any provider's store. It filters suggestions to Alibaba/Google/Meta/Microsoft/DeepSeek/Mistral/Zhipu so third-party fine-tunes that Ollama won't have under the same name don't pollute the output.

## Related projects

This skill sits at the intersection of three personal projects, and is observed by a fourth. These are the upstream author's portfolio infrastructure — useful context for the design decisions, but none of them is required to use or fork the skill (`llmfit` remains an optional PATH check either way).

[`local-brain`](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/local-brain) is the source of the framing this skill operationalises. The core finding — local models are strong summarisers and weak agents, so delegation is a shell pipe rather than an orchestration layer — comes directly from that work, and is why this skill is implemented as bash scripts rather than a framework.

[`ai-model-advisor`](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/ai-model-advisor) supplies the tier classification (`code` / `prose` / `reasoning` / `long-context`) and the "smallest model sufficient" environmental philosophy that `pick-model.sh` encodes. When you change the preference order in that script, the rationale you are applying is the one ai-model-advisor argues for: bigger is not better when a 9GB model handles the prompt in half the time.

[`llmfit`](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/llmfit) is an optional dependency that enables hardware-aware upgrade suggestions in `audit-models.sh`. When llmfit is not on PATH the audit prints routing only and skips the upgrade-check section with a hint. When it is present, the audit feeds llmfit's hardware-scored recommendations through a first-party-provider filter and surfaces upgrades that beat the installed leader by 3+ points. Patterns the audit script learns about Ollama-vs-HuggingFace name mappings (`hf_stem` normalisation) flow back to llmfit when worth generalising.

[`repo-butler`](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/repo-butler) tracks repo health across the portfolio. No integration work is needed here — repo-butler picks up new repos automatically once they exist on GitHub, and this one is now visible to it. It monitors the upstream repo only; forks are not observed and lose nothing by it.

## Maintenance

A monthly reminder to re-run `scripts/audit-models.sh` is automated via [`.github/workflows/monthly-audit-reminder.yml`](.github/workflows/monthly-audit-reminder.yml). The workflow opens a tracking issue on the 1st of each month (idempotent — skips when one is already open) because the audit needs the local providers running and can't run on the hosted runner; `workflow_dispatch` is the manual escape hatch.
