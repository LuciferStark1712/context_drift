# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

This repo *is* a Claude Code skill, not an application that uses one. Editing `SKILL.md` changes how Claude itself behaves whenever the skill is loaded. Treat `SKILL.md` as production prompt content, not documentation: its frontmatter `description` is the prompt Claude reads to decide whether to invoke the skill, so an edit to it changes trigger accuracy in every conversation that has the skill installed. Keep the MUST/MUST NOT structure intact, and gate every `description` edit with the trigger eval below (recall ≥ 0.9 and negative-precision ≥ 0.9).

The skill routes "gather context once, send one prompt, return text" tasks to a local model (MLX, Docker Model Runner or Ollama) over a shell pipe. There is no framework, router process or orchestration layer: the runtime path is `scripts/pick-model.sh` and `scripts/delegate.sh`, and everything else (recipes, hooks, the calibration loop, CI gates) exists to make that one path reliable. The discriminator for what belongs here is the local-brain insight: local models are strong summarisers and weak agents, so a task that needs multi-step reasoning, repo-wide context or tool-calling does not belong even if it looks textual. `ROADMAP.md` "Out of scope" enumerates the boundaries.

## Commands

There is no build step and no package manager. Run the whole suite (every file mocks `curl`, so a machine with a live model server gets the same counts as CI):

```bash
for f in tests/run-tests.sh tests/test-*.sh; do bash "$f"; done
```

Delegate, with or without a recipe (a recipe's tier comes from its frontmatter; `--tier` overrides):

```bash
echo "<context>" | bash scripts/delegate.sh prose "<prompt>"
bash scripts/delegate.sh --recipe commit-message --var diff_stat=... --var why=... --var recent_commits="$(git log --oneline -5)" "commit message"
bash scripts/pick-model.sh <code|prose|reasoning|long-context|vision|embedding|premium-general|reasoning-vision>
bash scripts/audit-models.sh        # read-only: tier routing plus llmfit upgrade suggestions
```

Record a verdict on every delegation, pinned with the `id="..."` the `delegate-meta:` line printed. `hit` means kept as-is, `scaffold` edited and shipped, `miss` rewritten or discarded; scaffold and miss need a reason, and `--final` stores the shipped text beside the draft:

```bash
bash scripts/delegate-feedback.sh --id <id> hit
bash scripts/delegate-feedback.sh --id <id> --final reply.txt miss "dropped every file:line anchor"
```

Read the metrics and run the calibration loop:

```bash
bash scripts/metrics-summary.sh --days 7          # or --since YYYY-MM-DD
bash scripts/self-improve.sh --peek --days 7      # evidence bundle; exit 10 = nothing new; without --peek it advances the watermark
bash scripts/replay-recipe.sh --recipe maintainer-reply --candidate /path/to/worktree/prompts   # gate a recipe edit before its PR
```

The validation pipeline CI runs on every PR, runnable locally:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-frontmatter.sh SKILL.md
bash scripts/validate-skill-content.sh SKILL.md
bash scripts/eval-skill-triggers.sh                           # eval-set shape only
bash scripts/eval-skill-triggers.sh --local deepseek-r1:32b   # pre-merge trigger gate for a description edit (free, on-device)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… bash scripts/eval-skill-triggers.sh --api # what CI runs when SKILL.md or evals/ change and the secret is set
find scripts tests .claude/hooks -name '*.sh' -print0 | xargs -0 shellcheck -S error
```

`.claude/hooks/post-edit-validate.sh` runs the frontmatter, content and eval-shape checks on save, not the trigger-accuracy gate.

## Architecture

`scripts/pick-model.sh` is the single source of truth for tier-to-model routing. Each tier holds a case-insensitive substring preference list, highest capability first, and the first served model matching one wins. `code`, `prose`, `reasoning` and `long-context` are active; `vision`, `embedding`, `premium-general` and `reasoning-vision` resolve only when a matching model is served. When the model set changes, edit the `prefs` in this script; never hardcode model names in `SKILL.md` or in delegation pipes. Discovery and dispatch go through `DELEGATE_BASE_URL`, an ordered list of OpenAI-compatible base URLs defaulting to MLX (`:8080/v1`), Docker Model Runner (`:12434/engines/v1`) and Ollama (`:11434/v1`), each overridable by `MLX_HOST`, `DOCKER_MODEL_HOST` and `OLLAMA_HOST`. Each is probed with `GET {base}/models` (1 s, `DELEGATE_PROBE_TIMEOUT`); the first reachable one serving a preferred model wins, and MLX leads because ADR 0022 measured it about ten times faster than Ollama on identical weights. "Installed" means a running provider reports it, never a filesystem scan.

`scripts/delegate.sh` is the wrapper `SKILL.md` teaches. It resolves `<base>\t<model>` with `pick-model.sh --print-resolution` and posts to `{base}/chat/completions` with `temperature:0`, `stream:false` and `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` (false unless `DELEGATE_THINK=true`); the raw `/v1/completions` endpoint is avoided because it bypasses the chat template. Each call appends one JSON row to `~/.local/share/delegate-local/metrics.jsonl` with a `backend` label derived from the winning URL (`DELEGATE_LOCAL_NO_METRICS=1` opts out), and stores the draft, and for recipe calls the rendered input and structured inputs, under `drafts/` beside it. `--recipe NAME` loads `prompts/<NAME>.md`, substitutes `{{key}}` from `--var` and `{{stdin}}` from the pipe, and exits 2 on any unsubstituted placeholder. Recipe calls also run a 1-token pre-flight canary (exit 3 on a stall), weak-input labels, the deterministic output checks and at most one retry; all of that is in `docs/checks.md`.

Shared code lives in `scripts/lib/`: `recipe.sh` (every recipe reader, including `recipe_template_sha`), `checks.sh` (`run_output_checks`), `text.sh` (sentence, normalise and anchor helpers shared by the checks and the scorer), `pair-score.sh` and `pair.jq` (draft/final scoring and the verdict join used by `metrics-summary.sh`, `self-improve.sh` and `replay-recipe.sh`), `otel.sh` (`delegate_project_name` and opt-in span emission), `hook.sh` (the hooks' shared preamble) and `shell-words.pl` (the hooks' shell-word tokenizer).

A delegation is filed under the main repository's basename (`delegate_project_name`, so a linked worktree files under its repo); outside a git repository the `project` field is omitted rather than set to the cwd's basename, and `--project NAME` or `DELEGATE_PROJECT` override. `delegate-feedback.sh` copies the project off the row it references.

The opt-in hooks close the loop around posting. `scripts/delegate-boundary-hook.sh` (`PreToolUse` on Bash) classifies `git commit`, `gh`/`glab` PR, issue, review and comment posts, records an opportunity row, credits a recent delegation for that boundary's recipe, and denies an undrafted post on the enforced boundaries with a command that runs as printed. `scripts/delegate-boundary-confirm-hook.sh` (`PostToolUse`) confirms the credited call succeeded, stores the posted body as the draft's shipped final, and lets a refused post be retried on the same credit. `scripts/delegate-verdict-stop-hook.sh` (`Stop`) hands the session's unverdicted delegations back to the agent once. `scripts/onboard.sh` reports and installs them. Capture, ritual tagging, markers and modes are in `docs/boundary-hook.md`.

`prompts/` is the recipe library (13 recipes since #616 retired ten unused ones); `prompts/README.md` covers the template conventions and how a recurring hit graduates into a recipe, and `tests/test-prompts-library.sh` enforces each recipe's structure. Every recipe edit gets a dated entry in `docs/calibration/<recipe>.md` (the recipe's `## Calibration notes` is a one-line pointer there) and a replay verdict.

`docs/self-improvement-loop.md` is the calibration procedure: the `self-improve.sh` bundle, quarantined finals, the replay gate, the launchd daily runner (`scripts/self-improve-daily.sh`), verdict recording and the metrics rollup.

## Conventions

Portability is a real constraint. Runtime deps are `bash` 3.2+ (macOS-shipped), `jq`, `awk`, `perl` and `curl`. Avoid associative arrays (bash 4 only) and `grep -P` (GNU only); use `perl -CSD` for unicode-aware regex, and keep every new regex or glob linear-time (no nested quantifiers). ShellCheck at `-S error` is the one linter, configured by `.shellcheckrc`.

Tests share `tests/lib/assert.sh` (#561: the asserts and counters, `SAFE_PATH`, `mock_curl`, and `HOME`/`TMPDIR` pinned to a temp dir so a developer's `config.sh` and `profile.sh` never reach a test); files adopt it as they are next touched. CI discovers every `tests/test-*.sh` plus `tests/run-tests.sh`, so a new test file needs no `ci.yml` edit. The prose-tier ordering test in `tests/run-tests.sh` (qwen3.6 ahead of qwen3-next) encodes a measured baseline; do not relax it without re-measuring, and expect that suite to change when you reorder `pick-model.sh` preferences.

`ROADMAP.md` is the authoritative plan. When asked to continue earlier work, start from its "Active work" section, which names the tracking epic, the next issues in order and the working method.

Not everything absent from `main` was never built. Commit `22395b2` ("chore: archive research/observability machinery out of main") deleted 406 files, including working tooling that was later restored (the verdict scripts in #416, `scripts/apply-and-test.sh` in #419). Before writing a new helper, check `git show --numstat --format="" 22395b2 | grep -F '<name>'`.

The metrics corpus restarted from zero on 2026-08-19 (ADR 0028); the earlier rows are archived under `~/.local/share/delegate-local/archive/2026-08-19-pre-reset/` and no rate from before that date is comparable to a live one. Quote the N beside every rate you read from `metrics-summary.sh`; at this sample size one delegation moves every percentage.

## The live install on the maintainer's machine

End users install with `npx skills add IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local` (`README.md` has the manual fallback). On the maintainer's machine, since #360 both `~/.claude-home/skills/delegate-local` and `~/.claude-work/skills/delegate-local` are symlinks to `~/.local/share/delegate-local-live`, a separate clone of `origin/main` (a clone, not a worktree, so `git worktree prune` can never delete it); the hooks in both profiles call `~/.claude/skills/delegate-local/scripts/…` through it. This checkout's branch therefore does not change what other sessions run. After a merge, update the live skill with `git -C ~/.local/share/delegate-local-live pull --ff-only`. Test unmerged code by running scripts from this checkout or a worktree by path with `DELEGATE_LOCAL_DATA_DIR` or `DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE` pointed at a scratch location, and never repoint either symlink at this checkout. The data dir `~/.local/share/delegate-local` (metrics, drafts, `config.sh`, `profile.sh`) is outside every checkout.

## Repo Butler

This repo is monitored by [Repo Butler](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/repo-butler), a portfolio health agent that observes repo health daily and generates dashboards, governance proposals, and tier classifications.

**Your report:** https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/repo-butler/delegate-local.html
**Portfolio dashboard:** https://ismaelmartinez.github.io/repo-butler/
**Consumer guide:** https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/repo-butler/blob/main/docs/consumer-guide.md

### Querying Reginald (the butler MCP server)

To query your repo's health tier, governance findings, and portfolio data from any Claude Code session, add the MCP server once (adjust the path to your local repo-butler checkout):

```bash
claude mcp add repo-butler node /path/to/repo-butler/src/mcp.js
```

Available tools: `get_health_tier`, `get_campaign_status`, `query_portfolio`, `get_snapshot_diff`, `get_governance_findings`, `trigger_refresh`.

When working on health improvements, check the per-repo report for the current tier checklist and use the consumer guide for fix instructions.

If this repo deploys a page, set its GitHub repository Homepage URL (the Website field in the repo's About section — not `package.json`'s `homepage`) to the canonical URL. That's how repo-butler surfaces the deployed link in dashboards and agent cards.
