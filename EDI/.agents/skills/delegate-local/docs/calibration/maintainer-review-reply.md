# Calibration history for [`prompts/maintainer-review-reply.md`](../../prompts/maintainer-review-reply.md)

## Calibration notes

Drafted 2026-08-26 from a measured scope mismatch rather than from a coverage gap. `maintainer-reply` had absorbed 29 of 58 delegations in the rolling window at a 3% keep rate, and the rejection reasons were one shape repeated: the recipe's closed two-sentence cap meeting a workload of evidence-led review replies it explicitly excludes ("Not for: ... multi-paragraph technical explanations"). The drafting skills had started routing every maintainer comment through the one recipe that existed, so the cap ate the evidence every time.

The alternative considered and rejected was widening `maintainer-reply`. Its two-sentence cap is its identity — the shape that fits a diagnostic one-liner — and the library's design is one closed shape per recipe. Widening it would have cost the short shape without reliably buying the long one.

Un-validated on first commit: written from nine rejection reasons and the shipped replies that replaced those drafts, not yet from its own HIT. Expect the first ten calls to move it. The pairing to watch is `no_example_echo` against ANCHOR-PRESERVATION: this recipe's skeleton is deliberately anchor-free so that a leak of it is visibly bracketed rather than a plausible fabrication.

### 2026-08-26 (later) — no_single_item_list declared before the first call

This recipe carries the same rule as `maintainer-reply.md` ("A single ask is
never a list") and inherits its history: there the rule survived two rewordings
and had to become a deterministic check. Declaring `no_single_item_list` here
now, at n=0 calls, costs one frontmatter line and stops the identical defect
being re-discovered from scratch on a recipe that already knows about it.

### Tier choice

Prose tier. The task is reshaping supplied facts into a maintainer's voice; the facts are passive content to preserve and order, not reasoning targets. Same discriminator as `maintainer-reply.md`. If a future measurement shows anchor preservation failing on the prose tier specifically, the reasoning tier is the escalation to try before rewriting the guards again.

### 2026-08-26 (later) — the routing became mechanical

Still `n=0` calls at the end of the day it was created, with pointers in
SKILL.md and in both scope paragraphs of `maintainer-reply.md`. The reason turned
out to be structural rather than persuasive: `gh pr review --body`, the most
common way a maintainer posts a judgement, was not a boundary in
`scripts/delegate-boundary-hook.sh` at all. It cleared the pre-filter, matched no
branch, and produced no opportunity row and no reminder, so nothing ever named
this recipe at the moment of drafting. The hook now classifies it (and a `POST`
to `.../pulls/<n>/reviews`) as `pr-review-body` and names this recipe with its
`verdict` and `ask` vars.

`gh pr comment` still routes to `maintainer-reply`, pinned by its own assertion,
so the fix cannot quietly swallow the closed short shape. Re-measure by whether
this recipe starts taking calls at all; anything about its keep rate needs
roughly ten of them first.

### 2026-08-27 — the second routing fix

`#440` made `gh pr review --body` a boundary that names this recipe; it has
taken no traffic since, because that is not the command the sessions on this
machine actually use. `gh pr comment` is, and it was pinned to
`maintainer-reply`. The hook now routes it by the size of the body being
posted, so a long evidence-led comment names this recipe.

Still `n=0` calls. Two mechanical routing fixes are now in place and the honest
status is that neither has been measured. Re-measure by whether this recipe
starts taking calls at all; anything about its keep rate needs roughly ten of
them first.

### 2026-08-27 — what the routing threshold was measured against

The 600-character split that sends a comment here rather than to
`maintainer-reply` was a guess when it shipped. The population it routes was
measured the same day — 27 maintainer-authored issue comments on this repo,
min 8, p25 573, median 950, p75 1417, max 2522 — and the split sends 19 of the
27 to this recipe. That is the traffic
this recipe has been waiting for, so the next reading of its keep rate has a
denominator to work with. Still `n=0` calls at the time of writing.

### 2026-09-11 — the reply was the input handed back, and the opener rule was fighting the verdicts

The traffic arrived and the recipe failed it in one shape. Measured on live
rows from 2026-08-28 to 2026-09-11 (agent verdicts, `--source agent`): 46
rejections here and 51 on `maintainer-reply`, 97 in all, with
`self-improve.sh --peek --days 14` reporting usable rates of 71% here
(kept=0, scaffold=33, rewrote=13) and 66% there (kept=0, scaffold=34,
rewrote=17). Not one draft in the window was kept as-is on either recipe. 63
of the 97 rejection reasons said the draft restated the supplied context back:
"restated the whole stdin context verbatim as three long paragraphs", "copied
the context brief sentence for sentence, including internal framing", "echoed
all eleven stdin fact lines verbatim". The size signature says the same thing
without any reading: rejected output here ran p50 1637 characters against a
context p50 of 1627. The draft was its input (#475).

That is the 2026-08-26 failure inverted. The ANCHOR-PRESERVATION note above
was written from nine drafts that had compressed 7-9 KB of facts to under 500
characters, and "the reply IS the evidence" fixed that by being read
literally: the model now returned the evidence wholesale instead of curating
it. No check caught it because `no_example_echo` compares against the
pre-substitution template only, on purpose, so every one of the 46 rejections
here carried `checks_failed=0` and none took the #384 retry.

Three changes. ANCHOR-PRESERVATION and LENGTH now say what preservation means:
the anchors (paths, line references, numbers, hashes, PR and issue numbers)
carried inside sentences the model writes, never the supplied sentences
themselves, and a reply the length of the FACTS block built from its lines is
named as the second failure beside brevity. `no_context_echo` is declared in
the frontmatter and fails a draft that reproduces two or more sentences of the
piped context verbatim (both sides split into sentences first, then the same
normalisation and 40-character floor as `no_example_echo`), so the retry now
fires with the constraint named; one echoed sentence is left alone because
quoting a single fact back is exactly the anchor-carrying the recipe asks for.
The unit is the sentence and not the line because the rejected drafts are one
paragraph line each (the 2026-09-10T20:00:01Z row: context 1687 characters,
body one 1687-character line), so a whole-line compare matched none of them.
And the opener: 39 of the 97 reasons wanted a thanks first ("no thanks
opener", "opened with the verdict instead of thanks") while the template said
"Do not open by thanking" twice, so the recipe's house shape and the verdicts
disagreed on every call that had one. Resolved the way `signoff` already
works: an optional `opener` input the caller supplies verbatim, placed after
the handle and before the verdict. The model still never invents gratitude,
and with no opener the verdict still comes first.

Re-measure after roughly ten calls each. The number to watch is the ratio of
output to context characters on rejected rows, which should drop well below
1.0, and whether `no_context_echo` appears in `checks_failed_names` at all: if
the retry clears it, the row shows `retried:true` with no failed check; if it
does not, the model cannot curate this input and the reply is hand-written.

### 2026-09-14 — the ceiling had to be stated relative to the input

Measured on agent verdicts over 13-14 September, the first window after #475
(PR #478, merged 2026-09-11) declared `no_context_echo` here: n=16, kept 0,
scaffold 0, rewrote 16, usable 0%. Every rejected draft was still the fact
sheet handed back, and the size pairs say so without any reading: 1172
characters out for 981 in, 557 for 560, 940 for 899. `no_context_echo` fired
on 7 of the 38 reply calls across this recipe and `maintainer-reply.md`, and
the #384 retry ran on 9 of them, so the check catches the failure; the second
generation came back the same size as the first every time, so the retry
notice ("do not copy sentences of the supplied facts into the answer") does
not change the output. The recipe set no length target: LENGTH named a reply the
length of the FACTS block as a failure but never said how long the reply
should be, and the rules said only that it carries the anchors and stops
after the ask.

The ceiling is a declared check, not a prose rule. A first cut said in the
Rules block that the reply is SHORTER than the FACTS block and put the same
sentence into the `no_context_echo` retry constraint; review of PR #488
withdrew both. The rule contradicted LENGTH ("a dozen facts is three or four
paragraphs"), cannot be met on a three-line fact list once the opener,
verdict, anchors, ask and sign-off are all mandatory, and does not
discriminate: 3 of the 16 rejected rows (557/560, 547/578, 318/329) were
already shorter than their input and still echoing. And `no_context_echo`
measures echo, so its notice cannot claim a length rule was broken. So
`max_context_ratio: 0.8` is declared in the frontmatter (ADR 0014 machinery:
counted in `checks_run`, named in `checks_failed_names`, retried once with
its own constraint), failing when the output is at least 0.8 of the context
by characters and the context is at least 400 characters
(`min_context_chars`, so a short fact list is exempt); the Rules block
carries a CURATION rule consistent with LENGTH instead, carry the anchors and
state the judgement, never the facts' sentences, and on a fact list of more
than a few lines run well under its length; and LENGTH itself now says the
reply runs well under the FACTS block whatever the paragraph count, since a
sentence that joins two facts and drops their framing is shorter than the
two facts were. The 16 rows carry one identical reason pasted 16 times at
11:00 on 2026-09-13, which is why `delegate-feedback.sh` now warns on a
reason repeated across delegations inside ten minutes; the figures above are
the size pairs, which do not depend on the reason text.

Re-measure after roughly ten calls. The number to watch is unchanged from
2026-09-11, the ratio of output to context characters on rejected rows, plus
two more: whether `max_context_ratio` appears in `checks_failed_names` after
the retry, and the second generation's size on rows with `retried:true`. If
the retry still returns the input's length, the model cannot curate this
input and the constraint sentence is not the lever.

### 2026-09-16 — the retry does not clear the echo, and the floor rejected shipped replies

The re-measure asked for above came back on both counts (#514). Over the
live corpus the #384 retry clears the failed check on `commit-message` 23
of 33 times and on `maintainer-reply` 10 of 13; here it retried 12 times
and 8 still failed afterwards, all 8 on `no_context_echo`, the second
generation the same size and the same echo as the first. The agent-framework
spike gave the model a stronger repair signal (the full conversation, the
exact echoed sentences, two retries) and left the echo in place on every
case of this recipe, so the notice is not the lever and each retry was a
second generation of roughly the context length for nothing. `delegate.sh`
now skips the retry when `no_context_echo` is the only failed check: the
check still fails, prints its reject and is named on the row, and the row
carries no `retried` or `retry_chars`. Beside any other failed check
(`max_context_ratio`, `no_single_item_list`) the retry still runs.

The other count is the floor. Of the 5 shipped replies in the spike set, 2
failed `max_context_ratio` as declared: 789 characters on 832 of facts
(0.95) and 813 on 693 (1.17). Those are replies the maintainer posted, so
on a fact list that size the rule was measuring the wrong thing, and no
shipped reply in that set over 900 characters of facts exceeds the ratio.
`min_context_chars: 900` is declared in the frontmatter. Measured over all
43 stored finals of this recipe rather than the spike's 5, the floor takes
the failures from 14 to 3: two genuine posts at 0.84 (816 on 966, 791 on
940) and one scratch document stored as a final (2802 on 1687), so the
number to watch is whether `max_context_ratio` still fires on a reply the
agent then keeps.

Re-measure after roughly ten calls. A row whose only failed check is
`no_context_echo` should carry neither `retried` nor `retry_chars`, rows
with `retried:true` should name another check beside it or none, and no
stored `.final.txt` under 900 characters of facts should fail the ratio.

### 2026-09-20 — the drafts were obeying ANCHOR-PRESERVATION and the maintainer was rejecting the obedience

The first calibration pass with structured inputs (#534) read 52 rejections
between 2026-09-19T21:13Z and 2026-09-20T10:16Z, every one with its draft,
inputs and shipped text; 27 of them said the caller "shipped the
pre-written form", and 22 that the draft "restated" the change back at its
author. Seven-day figures: n=147, kept 0, scaffold 131, rewrote 16, usable
89%; thirty-day, n=194 tracked, kept 0, usable 79%. The usable goal (60%) is
met and the kept goal (10%) is at zero, and the reasons say why: every
draft was an edit away from posting, and the edit was always the same one.

Measured with `delegate.sh`'s own `fact_anchors` over the 19 rejected drafts
of this recipe that had `inputs.json`, taking the piped facts' anchors minus
any that the caller's own `--var` values carried: the drafts carried 40-100%
of them (17 of the 19 with eight or more anchors in the facts sat at 0.38 or
above), and the replies the maintainer shipped carried a median 6%, none
above 0.35. The shipped replies ran 36 to 120 words; the drafts 100 to 250.
Only 6 of the 28 reply-recipe rejections carried a failed check, so
`no_context_echo` and `max_context_ratio` were seeing a minority: the drafts
were not echoing sentences or matching the facts' length, they were
describing the contributor's own PR back to them, in the model's sentences,
with every anchor the recipe demanded. Four of the four facts blocks read in
full ended with the caller's own spec ("Under 60 words, thanks first, verdict
first, no em-dashes"), which the recipe reads as a fact and LENGTH overrode.

So the rule was the defect. ANCHOR-PRESERVATION was written on 2026-08-26
against nine drafts that compressed 7-9 KB of facts to under 500
characters, and the replies the maintainer ships today are 225 to 787
bytes: the recipe was tuned to a shape nobody posts. The two later prompt
fixes (2026-09-11, 2026-09-14) added LENGTH and CURATION beside a rule that
forbade curation, which is why neither moved the online read. Per
`docs/self-improvement-loop.md` this is the third attempt on the defect and
therefore not a rewording but a narrower task: the FACTS block is the
maintainer's notes and the reply draws on it; evidence is what was verified
and what it showed, never what the change does; an anchor goes in only when
the reader needs it to act or to check; `{{max_words}}` is an optional input
with an 80-word default and the LENGTH block states it as a cap; the
verdict, the evidence and the ask are separate paragraphs (7 of the 28
pairs carried a SHAPE line, draft one paragraph against three shipped). The
frontmatter checks are unchanged so the replay compares templates and not
check declarations; tightening `max_context_ratio` to the new length is the
follow-up once the online read confirms.

The offline gate is `replay-recipe.sh` (ADR 0031 as amended); its summary
and verdict lines are in the PR that carries this edit. Re-measure online
once this template has thirty tracked rows: the per-template section of the
bundle prints this hash beside `8f97253928bc`, and the number to watch is
kept, which has been 0 on every read of this recipe since 2026-08-19.

### 2026-09-22 — the reply @-mentioned people the caller had not addressed it to

Two replies went out to `teams-for-linux` opening `@tomgunning` and
`@dedalusMohantyMa`. Neither call passed `recipient`, and both names came
from the piped facts, where they belonged to the reporter of a *referenced*
issue rather than to the contributor being answered. The order block has
said since #520 that an empty Recipient block means "no handle and no `@` at
all, so address the reader as you"; prose did not hold it.

Measured across the stored corpus of both reply recipes (every delegation
with `inputs.json`, a verdict and a stored final): 42 of 82 rejected drafts
carry an `@`-mention that is not the supplied recipient, every one of them on
a call that supplied no recipient at all, against 0 of the 81 replies the
maintainer actually posted. That gap is the whole case for a check: the
model reaches for a handle when the caller names nobody, and the maintainer
takes it out every time.

So `no_unbidden_mention: recipient` is declared in the frontmatter. It fails
on any mention that is not the recipient var's handle, and on every mention
when that var is empty. It deliberately does NOT ask whether the handle
appears in the input: in both live cases it did, which is precisely why the
draft looked reasonable. It earns the #384 retry, unlike `no_context_echo`
and `no_fact_as_question`, because deleting a mention is a change the second
generation can actually make rather than a judgement it has already failed.

Re-measure after roughly ten calls. The number to watch is whether
`no_unbidden_mention` appears in `checks_failed_names` after the retry: if
the second generation still carries the mention, the constraint sentence is
not the lever and the mention should be stripped rather than regenerated.
