# Environment variables

Every `DELEGATE_*` variable a script under `scripts/` reads, listed once. All are optional: an unset variable takes the default shown. "Data dir" is `DELEGATE_LOCAL_DATA_DIR`, default `~/.local/share/delegate-local`. Where a script also takes a flag for the same setting, the flag wins. The internal include guard `_DELEGATE_OTEL_LIB_LOADED` in `scripts/lib/otel.sh` is not a setting and is left out.

## Providers and dispatch

| Variable | Default | Effect | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DELEGATE_BASE_URL` | `${MLX_HOST:-http://localhost:8080}/v1 ${DOCKER_MODEL_HOST:-http://localhost:12434}/engines/v1 ${OLLAMA_HOST:-http://localhost:11434}/v1` | Space-separated, ordered list of OpenAI-compatible base URLs; the first reachable one serving a model the tier prefers wins. Entries with `user:pass@` are refused. | `pick-model.sh`, `audit-models.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_PROBE_TIMEOUT` | `1` | Seconds for each `GET {base}/models` probe. | `pick-model.sh`, `audit-models.sh`, `eval-skill-triggers.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_LOCAL_CONFIG` | `<data dir>/config.sh` | Per-user routing overrides sourced after the shipped tier preferences. | `pick-model.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Seconds the 1-token canary may take before a recipe call exits 3. | `delegate.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_NO_PREFLIGHT` | unset | `1` skips the canary on recipe calls. | `delegate.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `600` | `curl --max-time` in seconds for the generation request. | `delegate.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_MAX_TOKENS` | `4096` | `max_tokens` sent with the request; must be a positive integer. | `delegate.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_TEMPERATURE` | unset (greedy, `0`) | Sampling temperature; only an explicit value is recorded on the row. | `delegate.sh` |
| `DELEGATE_THINK` | `false` | `true` sends `enable_thinking: true` through the chat template. | `delegate.sh`, `eval-skill-triggers.sh --local` |
| `DELEGATE_STRIP_THINK` | unset | `1` strips everything up to the first `</think>`; the `reasoning` tier strips by default and `0` turns that off. | `delegate.sh` |

## Recipes and output checks
