# Install — Claude Code

Claude Code reads skills from `~/.claude/skills/` (user-scoped) and `<project>/.claude/skills/` (project-scoped); the project path takes precedence when both exist. The skill auto-loads when its frontmatter `description` triggers — no manual activation needed.

## Recommended

```bash
npx skills add IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local -a claude-code
```

The `-a claude-code` flag scopes the install to Claude Code only, so the skill is not also installed into other agent tools the CLI detects. Add `-g` if you want the install to be user-scoped (`~/.claude/skills/delegate-local`) rather than project-scoped, and `--copy` on systems where symlinks do not work (most network filesystems, some Windows configurations).

## Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local
ln -s "$PWD/delegate-local" ~/.claude/skills/delegate-local
```

For project-scoped install replace `~/.claude/skills/` with `<project>/.claude/skills/`. Use `cp -r` instead of `ln -s` if symlinks are not an option.

## Verify

Ask Claude Code something the skill should fire on, for example "summarise this build log" or "draft a commit message for this diff", and confirm it announces "Delegated to <model> (<tier> tier)" before producing the output. If it answers without delegating, check that `~/.claude/skills/delegate-local/SKILL.md` exists and that `ollama list` shows at least one installed model in the resolved tier. The audit script gives both signals at once:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/delegate-local/scripts/audit-models.sh
```

## Trigger reliability on commits and PRs (optional hook)

Standalone asks ("summarise this log") fire the skill reliably, but a commit message or PR body buried inside a larger "implement X, commit, open a PR" instruction often gets written inline instead — the agent never re-runs skill selection mid-task. If you notice that pattern, install the opt-in `PreToolUse` boundary hook and its `PostToolUse` companion, which fires at the `git commit` / `gh pr create` / `gh issue create` / reply moment itself and requires the agent to draft the artifact locally where the recipe is proven (commit messages, issue bodies, comment and review replies) and reminds it elsewhere; `DELEGATE_BOUNDARY_MODE=warn` makes every boundary a reminder. It also records a per-project trigger-rate metric so you can see the gap close. See [`docs/boundary-hook.md`](boundary-hook.md).

## Per-machine routing override

`pick-model.sh` already picks the first preference a running provider serves, so most hosts need no override. To change the order for a tier on this host without forking the repo, write `~/.local/share/delegate-local/config.sh` by hand:

```bash
case "$tier" in
  prose) prefs=("gemma4" "qwen3.6") ;;
esac
```

The override is sourced after the shipped defaults so any tier it touches wins; untouched tiers fall through. See [`README.md`](../README.md#personalising-routing-recommended) for the full pattern.

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/delegate-local
```

The metrics file at `~/.local/share/delegate-local/metrics.jsonl` is per-user telemetry — delete it manually if you want to clear the local history.
