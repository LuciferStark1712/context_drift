# Install — MLX provider (Apple Silicon)

MLX is the first entry in the default provider list, so starting `mlx_lm.server` is the whole configuration: the next call probes `${MLX_HOST:-http://localhost:8080}/v1/models`, finds a model the tier prefers, and routes there. A host without it running falls through to the next provider in the list. To pin MLX and nothing else, set `DELEGATE_BASE_URL="${MLX_HOST:-http://localhost:8080}/v1"`.

On Apple Silicon, `mlx-lm` is an alternative inference runtime that uses Apple's native Metal kernels and unified-memory-aware KV cache. For the same Q8 model, MLX is typically 10–30% lighter on memory and faster on prefill than Ollama's llama.cpp backend (measured: 2× faster wall-clock, 25% lighter peak memory on `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit` — the rationale for preferring MLX when available is recorded in [`adr/0022-mlx-primary-backend-rationale.md`](adr/0022-mlx-primary-backend-rationale.md)). This guide covers the install steps plus the lifecycle differences vs Ollama.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or later). MLX has no CUDA path.
- `pipx` (`brew install pipx`) or a Python venv — either keeps `mlx-lm` isolated from your system Python.
- Enough disk space for the model weights. Q8 35B models are ~35 GB; 4-bit equivalents are ~18 GB.

The skill itself doesn't need a separate install — the existing `npx skills add` flow already lands the bash scripts. Only the MLX runtime is an additional dependency.

## Install `mlx-lm`

Via `pipx` (single command, globally available):

```bash
pipx install mlx-lm
```

Or via a Python venv (useful on systems where `pipx` is unavailable or when you want to pin the Python version):

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/venvs/mlx-lm
~/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/pip install mlx-lm
```

With the venv approach, binaries land under `~/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/` (e.g. `~/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/mlx_lm.server`) rather than on PATH. The launchd plist in the auto-start section below uses the full path, so either install method works.

Both give you `mlx_lm.generate` (one-shot CLI), `mlx_lm.server` (OpenAI-compatible HTTP server), `mlx_lm.manage` (cache management), and others. The skill uses the server.

## Pull a model

MLX models live on HuggingFace under the `mlx-community` org. Pull a model that matches one of the tier preferences (run `bash scripts/pick-model.sh --dry-run prose` to see the prefs list). For the prose tier on the reference host:

```bash
# 8-bit Q8 — matches the Ollama qwen3.6:35b-a3b-q8_0 in precision
huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Instruct-8bit

# Or 4-bit — roughly half the size, slightly lower accuracy
huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Instruct-4bit
```

`huggingface-cli` lands the weights under `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--<name>/snapshots/<hash>/`. Discovery asks the running server what it serves rather than scanning that directory, so the model becomes routable once `mlx_lm.server` is started with it, not merely once the download finishes.

## Start the server

### Manual (per-session)

```bash
mlx_lm.server --port 8080 &
```

Leave it running in the background. The first request triggers model load (5–15 s for a 35B model); subsequent requests use the warm cache. Pass `--model mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-8bit` to pin a specific model at startup; without it, the server loads whichever model name arrives in the first POST body.

### Auto-start via launchd (recommended on macOS)

Create a launchd agent so `mlx_lm.server` starts at login and restarts if it crashes. Adjust the `ProgramArguments` path to match your install method. Launchd does not inherit your shell PATH, so always use the absolute path to the binary — `pipx` typically puts it in `~/.local/bin/`, venv in `~/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/`.

Save to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.mlx-lm-server.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>com.local.mlx-lm-server</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<!-- pipx: use the absolute path, e.g. /Users/YOU/.local/bin/mlx_lm.server -->
		<!-- venv: use the full path, e.g. /Users/YOU/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/mlx_lm.server -->
		<string>/Users/YOU/venvs/mlx-lm/bin/mlx_lm.server</string>

		<string>--port</string>
		<string>8080</string>
		<string>--host</string>
		<string>127.0.0.1</string>
	</array>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
	<key>KeepAlive</key>
	<true/>
	<key>StandardOutPath</key>
	<string>/Users/YOU/Library/Logs/mlx-lm-server.log</string>
	<key>StandardErrorPath</key>
	<string>/Users/YOU/Library/Logs/mlx-lm-server.log</string>
	<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
	<dict>

		<string>/Users/YOU</string>
		<key>HF_HOME</key>
		<string>/Users/YOU/.cache/huggingface</string>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Replace `/Users/YOU` with your actual home directory. Then load the agent:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.mlx-lm-server.plist
```

Verify it came up:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/models | jq -r '.data[0].id'
```

To stop it temporarily (e.g. to reclaim memory), unload and reload later:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.mlx-lm-server.plist   # stop
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.mlx-lm-server.plist   # restart
```

Logs go to `~/Library/Logs/mlx-lm-server.log`. The `KeepAlive` key restarts the server if it crashes; `RunAtLoad` starts it at login. The auto-probe in `delegate.sh` picks it up transparently — no env-var changes needed.

## Route a delegation through MLX

Starting `mlx_lm.server` is enough — the next `delegate.sh` call probes it, finds it reachable, and routes through MLX without any env-var changes:

```bash
mlx_lm.server --port 8080 --model mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-Instruct-8bit &
bash scripts/delegate.sh prose "Summarise this paragraph in two sentences." </path/to/some.txt
```

To exclude every other provider (e.g. for testing), pin the list:

```bash
DELEGATE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1 bash scripts/delegate.sh prose "Summarise this paragraph in two sentences." </path/to/some.txt
```

`pick-model.sh` resolves the tier against what the server reports; `delegate.sh` posts to `http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions` (override via `MLX_HOST`) and parses `.choices[0].message.content`. The payload includes `chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}` so reasoning-capable models like Qwen3.6 emit their answer in `content` rather than the reasoning trace (set `DELEGATE_THINK=true` to flip it on per-call). The raw `/v1/completions` endpoint is deliberately avoided — it bypasses the model's chat template and produces whitespace-only output on instruction-tuned models. Every call appends a metrics row tagged `"backend":"mlx"` so `scripts/metrics-summary.sh` can break latency and token totals down per backend.

## Per-tier override

The default `max_tokens` is 4096. Raise it for the `long-context` tier or for verbose models:

```bash
DELEGATE_MAX_TOKENS=16384 bash scripts/delegate.sh long-context "..."
```

## What happens on a cross-tier request

`mlx_lm.server` holds one model resident at a time. The first request after install or restart pays a cold-load cost (~4 s for a 35B 8-bit model on the reference M5 Max, measured 2026-05-14). Same-model follow-up requests are warm (~0.2 s setup + completion time). A request that names a different model triggers an eviction-and-reload: the resident model is dropped, the new one is loaded from disk. KV cache does NOT survive a swap.

The reload is partly amortised by the macOS file cache. On the reference hardware, the second time a model is reloaded after eviction it costs roughly 1.6 s, down from ~4 s on the first cold-load. After that the cost stays in the ~1.6 s window as long as the OS file cache is not under pressure from other workloads. In practice this means a mixed-tier session pays a one-time ~4 s wait the first time it crosses each tier boundary, and ~1.6 s on every subsequent crossing. Linux MLX builds may produce different numbers — the file-cache amortisation observed here is macOS-specific.

If your workload mixes tiers in fast succession and the cumulative wait is noticeable, the rationale for not running a second `mlx_lm.server` instance per tier (which would eliminate the swap cost entirely at the cost of holding two models in unified memory simultaneously) is in [`docs/adr/0006-defer-multi-tier-resident-mlx.md`](adr/0006-defer-multi-tier-resident-mlx.md). The numbers above are the empirical reason the multi-resident design was deferred; if your numbers differ materially on different hardware, the ADR names the conditions under which to revisit.

## Verify

After install, the dry-run trace confirms routing:

```bash
DELEGATE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1 bash scripts/pick-model.sh --dry-run prose
```

The trace shows the provider list, the prefs list, and which model matched. If "no provider holds a model for tier" comes back, the model the server is serving doesn't contain any of the prefs substrings (case-insensitive); if "no provider is reachable" comes back, `mlx_lm.server` is not running on that port.

## Stop the server (reclaim memory)

`mlx_lm.server` keeps the model weights resident in unified memory between requests — that is what makes the second-request latency a fraction of the first. For a 35B 8-bit model that's ~36 GB held resident. For occasional users with other memory-hungry apps running, stop the server between sessions.

If running via launchd:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.mlx-lm-server.plist
```

If running manually:

```bash
pkill -f "mlx_lm.server"
```

The auto default will then probe, find nothing reachable, and route the next `delegate.sh` call through Ollama transparently. No env-var changes needed.

## Uninstall

```bash
pipx uninstall mlx-lm
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--*
```

The skill keeps working — auto-probing finds no MLX server, falls back to Ollama, and the existing Ollama path is untouched.
