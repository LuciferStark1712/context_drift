# Langfuse self-hosted — OTLP runbook

This is the privacy-conscious fallback when telemetry must stay on-device. Langfuse is the OSS LLM-observability stack (web UI plus async worker, backed by PostgreSQL plus ClickHouse for OLAP, with Redis and S3-compatible blob storage for queues and event payloads). Self-hosted via Docker Compose, no SaaS account, no data leaves the workstation.

## When to pick this

Langfuse self-hosted via docker-compose keeps all telemetry on the workstation, avoiding SaaS accounts and outbound traffic from the collector. It models user feedback as a first-class scores object, which maps cleanly to the hit or miss verdict from delegate-feedback.sh. The stack remains MIT-licensed throughout, despite the acquisition of ClickHouse Inc. This setup suits environments where data must stay on-device for compliance or where the score model forms the primary review surface.

## Prerequisites

- Docker plus Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose ...`).
- ~4 GB of free disk for the ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, and MinIO volumes during initial bring-up; production volumes grow with span count.
- Port 3000 free on localhost for the Langfuse web UI.

## One-file docker-compose.yml

Langfuse maintains a canonical `docker-compose.yml` in the [langfuse/langfuse GitHub repo](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/blob/main/docker-compose.yml). Pull the latest:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/langfuse && cd ~/langfuse
curl -fsSL -o docker-compose.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langfuse/langfuse/main/docker-compose.yml
```

The compose file brings up six services (see [Langfuse self-host docker-compose guide](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting/docker-compose) for the current authoritative reference):

- `langfuse-web` — `docker.io/langfuse/langfuse:3` on port `3000:3000` (the UI and ingest API).
- `langfuse-worker` — `docker.io/langfuse/langfuse-worker:3` on port `127.0.0.1:3030:3030` (async event processor).
- `clickhouse` — `docker.io/clickhouse/clickhouse-server` (OLAP store for traces, spans, observations).
- `postgres` — `docker.io/postgres:17` (transactional metadata: projects, users, API keys).
- `redis` — `docker.io/redis:7` (queue and cache).
- `minio` — `cgr.dev/chainguard/minio` (S3-compatible blob storage for raw events).

All sensitive defaults in the compose file are marked `# CHANGEME` — `SALT`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_AUTH`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, and the three `LANGFUSE_S3_*_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` values. For a workstation-local install, generate strong values once:

```bash
# Replace each CHANGEME with output of this command
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Bring everything up:

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Wait ~30 s for ClickHouse migrations to run
docker compose logs -f langfuse-web
```

The UI is then at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API-key extraction

Langfuse uses a public-key / secret-key pair for ingest authentication. Both are generated through the web UI, not the CLI.

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` and create an account (first user becomes the org owner).
2. Create a project (any name; this is the scope under which spans land).
3. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys → Create new API keys**.
4. Copy both the **Public Key** (`pk-lf-…`) and the **Secret Key** (`sk-lf-…`) — the secret displays once.

## OTLP endpoint and auth header

Langfuse exposes an OTLP-compatible ingest at `/api/public/otel/v1/traces` (signal-specific path; the base `/api/public/otel` works with collectors that auto-append `/v1/traces`). Authentication is HTTP Basic with `<public_key>:<secret_key>` base64-encoded. See [Langfuse OpenTelemetry get-started](https://langfuse.com/docs/opentelemetry/get-started) for the authoritative reference.

```bash
PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-1234567890"     # from the UI
SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-1234567890"     # from the UI
AUTH_B64=$(printf '%s:%s' "$PUBLIC_KEY" "$SECRET_KEY" | base64 | tr -d '\n')
# On GNU systems: base64 -w 0  to suppress wrapping
```

The full `Authorization` header is `Basic <AUTH_B64>`.

## Copy-pasteable env block

```bash
export DELEGATE_OTEL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:3000/api/public/otel/v1/traces"
export DELEGATE_OTEL_HEADERS="Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-public-key:secret-key>"
```

Substitute the base64 string from the auth step. Once exported, the next `delegate.sh` call posts one span per invocation; the matching `delegate-feedback.sh` call (`hit`, `scaffold "<reason>"` or `miss "<reason>"`) posts the feedback span, and Langfuse renders it as a [score](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview) attached to the parent trace via the OTLP span `links` field — making the hit / scaffold / miss verdict a first-class object in the UI rather than a buried attribute.

## Backfill historical metrics

The exporter only emits spans for new delegations going forward. If your `metrics.jsonl` already has weeks or months of pre-exporter rows, the Langfuse trace view and scores aggregates start empty until enough new traffic accumulates. To seed the project with the existing history, run the backfill script after the env vars above are exported:

```bash
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh                       # post every pre-exporter row
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh --since 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z  # only since a date
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh --dry-run             # preview without POSTing
```

Row-level idempotent: any row that was already exported live (carries `otel_trace_id` in the JSONL) is skipped, and rows that pre-date the exporter get deterministic trace and span IDs derived from `sha256(ts|source)` and `sha1(ts|source)`. Re-running the backfill — or resuming an interrupted run — collides in Langfuse's OTel ID space and produces no duplicate traces. The feedback rows in the JSONL are exported as feedback-spans linked to the parent delegation's deterministic IDs, so Langfuse's `scores` view also populates from the historical HIT/MISS verdicts.

## Dashboards (committed in `dashboards/langfuse/`)

Langfuse dashboards are session-views configured per-project through the web UI, not file-as-code artefacts the way Grafana ships — there is no portable dashboard JSON to import. The equivalent reproducible-from-scratch artefact is [`dashboards/langfuse/README.md`](../../dashboards/langfuse/README.md), which names the three views (Overview, Calibration, Errors) the Grafana JSON dashboards in `dashboards/grafana/` cover and explains how to recreate each one in Langfuse from saved filters, the Scores view, and a couple of sample public-API SQL queries. Follow the README after the exporter is wired and the first few spans have landed in the project.
