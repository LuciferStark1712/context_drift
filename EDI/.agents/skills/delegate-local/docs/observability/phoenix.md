# Phoenix — OTLP runbook

[Arize Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) is the ultra-light alternative to Grafana Cloud and Langfuse. A single container, SQLite-backed by default, zero configuration. Best for short-lived local inspection sessions where standing up ClickHouse and PostgreSQL would dwarf the data being inspected.

## When to pick this

Phoenix operates as a single Docker container with a default SQLite backend, requiring zero configuration to run. It translates OpenTelemetry gen_ai attributes into the OpenInference vocabulary at ingest, allowing immediate inspection of traces without external databases. This setup suits short-lived sessions where you need to review a handful of delegations without standing up complex infrastructure. The tool provides a native UI for this purpose rather than offering pre-built dashboards or first-class scoring models.

## One-liner bring-up

```bash
docker run -p 6006:6006 -p 4317:4317 -i -t arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

Port 6006 serves both the UI and the OTLP HTTP collector; 4317 is the OTLP gRPC collector for clients that prefer it. The container starts in ~5 seconds; no database to initialise, no migrations to run, no env vars required for a workstation install. State persists in the container's filesystem (back the SQLite file with `-v $HOME/phoenix:/phoenix-data` if you want it to survive `docker rm`).

The UI is then at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006). See [Phoenix Docker deployment docs](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker) for the authoritative reference, including the available image tags and volume-mount options for persistent storage.

## OTLP endpoint

Phoenix's OTLP HTTP traces endpoint is the standard signal-specific path:

```
http://localhost:6006/v1/traces
```

No authentication is required for the default workstation deployment — Phoenix expects to run on `localhost` behind whatever the host already trusts. (For shared deployments, see Phoenix's [authentication guide](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/deployment/authentication); the Track A exporter passes `DELEGATE_OTEL_HEADERS` through verbatim so any header-based scheme works.)

## OpenInference and gen_ai.* attribute translation

Phoenix uses [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) as its native semantic-convention layer, but the project ships an OpenInference-side converter that translates OTel's `gen_ai.*` semantic conventions into the OpenInference equivalents at ingest. The `delegate.sh` exporter emits the standard `gen_ai.*` namespace (the same attributes Grafana Cloud's GenAI dashboards key off), and Phoenix's `OpenInferenceSpanProcessor` performs the mapping so the spans show up in Phoenix's LLM-trace view with token counts, model name, provider, and latency populated. See the [Phoenix translating-conventions docs](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/concepts-tracing/translating-conventions) for the current mapping table — the relevant rows for this skill are `gen_ai.request.model → llm.model_name`, `gen_ai.provider.name → llm.provider`, `gen_ai.operation.name → openinference.span.kind`.

In practice this means: spans land in Phoenix without modifying the exporter, but UI panels surface them under Phoenix's vocabulary rather than the raw `gen_ai.*` attribute names. The trade-off is acceptable for the inspection use case Phoenix targets; for cross-tool dashboards (Grafana panels that key off `gen_ai.client.operation.duration`) the hosted Grafana Cloud path is the better fit.

## Copy-pasteable env block

```bash
export DELEGATE_OTEL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:6006/v1/traces"
```

No `DELEGATE_OTEL_HEADERS` is required for the default workstation install. Once exported, the next `delegate.sh` call posts one span per invocation; the matching `delegate-feedback.sh` call (`hit`, `scaffold "<reason>"` or `miss "<reason>"`) posts the feedback span with `links` to the parent — Phoenix renders the two as a linked trace pair under the parent's project view.

## Backfill historical metrics

The exporter only emits spans for new delegations going forward. If your `metrics.jsonl` already has weeks or months of pre-exporter rows, the Phoenix trace list starts empty until enough new traffic accumulates. To seed Phoenix with the existing history, run the backfill script after the env var above is exported:

```bash
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh                       # post every pre-exporter row
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh --since 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z  # only since a date
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh --dry-run             # preview without POSTing
```

Row-level idempotent: any row that was already exported live (carries `otel_trace_id` in the JSONL) is skipped, and rows that pre-date the exporter get deterministic trace and span IDs derived from `sha256(ts|source)` and `sha1(ts|source)`. Re-running the backfill — or resuming an interrupted run — collides in Phoenix's OTel ID space and produces no duplicate traces. The Phoenix LLM-trace view will then show the full historical timeline rather than starting from the first post-exporter delegation.

## Dashboards

Phoenix does not have an import-a-JSON-dashboard surface — the UI is the OpenInference LLM-trace view (spans listed under the project, click into a span to see attributes and the linked feedback). For the dashboard-style aggregates the Grafana and Langfuse backends ship, point those backends at this same exporter rather than reinventing the rollups inside Phoenix. The committed Grafana JSON files in [`dashboards/grafana/`](../../dashboards/grafana/) and the Langfuse view definitions in [`dashboards/langfuse/README.md`](../../dashboards/langfuse/README.md) are the reference for which slices matter: call volume by tier/recipe/backend, HIT-rate by recipe, canary-timeout rate. Within Phoenix, the filter bar at the top of the trace list accepts the same attribute names (e.g. `delegate.tier="prose"`, `delegate.recipe="commit-message"`, `delegate.exit_status="3"`) so the equivalent slice is recoverable per-session without a saved view.
