# Grafana + Tempo (local, self-hosted) — OTLP runbook

This is the on-device alternative to Grafana Cloud: a self-hosted Grafana + Tempo stack that runs the three committed dashboards on your own workstation, with no SaaS account and nothing leaving the box. The compose file and provisioning live in [`observability/`](../../observability/); the dashboards it loads are the same JSON files in [`dashboards/grafana/`](../../dashboards/grafana/) that the Grafana Cloud path imports.

## When to pick this

Choose the local Grafana, Tempo, and Loki backend when you require persistent per-recipe, per-tier, per-project, and HIT/MISS calibration dashboards that the Phoenix flat single-project trace view cannot display. This solution runs fully on-device as three Docker containers — Tempo for live trace storage and drill-down, Loki for the historical metrics the dashboards chart, and Grafana for the dashboards themselves — eliminating the need for a SaaS account and sending no data off the workstation. It offers a lighter footprint than the six-container Langfuse self-host stack while still charting the full history. The reason for the Loki container is a hard Tempo limitation: Tempo indexes blocks by ingestion time, so spans backfilled with old timestamps are unreachable at their real time and its TraceQL-metrics generator is forward-only. Loki accepts historical timestamps, so the dashboards read Loki — fed the complete `metrics.jsonl` by [`scripts/sync-metrics-to-loki.sh`](../../scripts/sync-metrics-to-loki.sh) — and a freshly started stack shows all of your past delegations immediately rather than building up only from new traffic. Tempo stays in the stack for opening an individual trace in Grafana Explore.

## Prerequisites

- Docker plus Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose ...`).
- Ports `4317`, `4318`, and `3200` free for Tempo (OTLP gRPC, OTLP HTTP, query API), `3100` free for Loki (push + query), and `3001` free for the Grafana UI. If you already run a Phoenix / otel-collector stack it is holding `4317`/`4318` — see the swap step below.
- ~1 GB of disk for the Tempo, Loki, and Grafana volumes at workstation scale.

## Bring it up

```bash
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Grafana comes up at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with anonymous admin access and no login form — the Tempo and Loki datasources and the three dashboards are provisioned automatically, so the `delegate-local` dashboard folder is populated on first start. Tempo's query API is at `http://localhost:3200` and Loki's is at `http://localhost:3100`.

The dashboard panels are empty until you load history into Loki — see the next section.

## Loading history into Loki

The dashboards chart LogQL over the delegate metrics JSONL, not Tempo traces, so they need that JSONL pushed into Loki. Run the sync once after bringing the stack up:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-metrics-to-loki.sh
```

It reads `~/.local/share/delegate-local/metrics.jsonl` (override with `--metrics-file` or `DELEGATE_METRICS_FILE`), pushes one log line per row stamped at the row's own `ts`, and records a line-offset watermark next to the file so re-runs only push rows appended since last time. That makes it safe to schedule for ongoing freshness — for example a `launchd` agent or a cron entry every few minutes:

```bash
*/5 * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/repo/scripts/sync-metrics-to-loki.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

The sync also enriches each feedback row with its parent delegation's `recipe`, `tier` and `estimated_tokens_avoided` (joined by `ref_id`, falling back to `ref_ts` for rows that pre-date it), so the calibration dashboard can break the verdict rates down by recipe and split tokens avoided into hit, scaffold and miss across the whole history, even though the feedback JSONL row itself stores only the verdict. Pass `--full` to ignore the watermark and re-push everything; Loki de-duplicates identical entries, so a full re-sync of unchanged rows is harmless. A change to the enrichment is not: each row's Loki timestamp carries a hash of the pushed line, so re-enriched feedback rows land beside the old ones instead of replacing them. After such a change, wipe Loki and rebuild it from the JSONL, which is its only source:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml rm -sf loki
docker volume rm delegate-local-observability_loki-data
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml up -d loki
bash scripts/sync-metrics-to-loki.sh --full
```

Point it at a non-default Loki with `--loki-url`.

Why not just backfill Tempo? Tempo indexes blocks by ingestion time, so a span sent now with a three-week-old timestamp lands in a "now" block and is unreachable when you query that historical window — and its metrics generator only aggregates live traffic forward. Loki accepts the historical timestamps directly, which is why the analytics live there. The `delegate.sh` exporter still sends live spans to Tempo, so individual traces remain available for drill-down in Grafana Explore via the Tempo datasource.

## Swapping in from a Phoenix / otel-collector stack

Tempo binds the standard OTLP ports `4317`/`4318` so the default `DELEGATE_OTEL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` routes here with no env change. If a Phoenix or otel-collector container already holds those ports, stop it first so Tempo can bind them:

```bash
docker stop otelcol phoenix     # whatever your current OTLP containers are named
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

If you would rather run this alongside an existing stack, remap Tempo's host ports in a compose override and point the env var at the new HTTP port — e.g. `4318 -> 14318`, then `export DELEGATE_OTEL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:14318/v1/traces"`.

## OTLP endpoint and env

No auth header is needed for the local workstation install. With the default ports the env is just:

```bash
export DELEGATE_OTEL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318/v1/traces"
```

Once exported, the next `delegate.sh` call posts one span per invocation and the matching `delegate-feedback.sh` call (`hit`, `scaffold "<reason>"` or `miss "<reason>"`) posts the feedback span linked to it.

## How the dashboards populate (read this before deciding the panels are broken)

The dashboards are powered by **TraceQL metrics** (`rate()`, `count_over_time()`, `histogram_over_time()`), which Tempo's `local-blocks` metrics processor computes from spans **as they are ingested live**. Two consequences are specific to the local backend and differ from Grafana Cloud:

- A freshly-sent span does not appear in the metric panels immediately — the processor only exposes it once it cuts a complete block, roughly one to two minutes after ingestion. The trace itself is searchable right away.
- `backfill-otel.sh` (below) replays your historical `metrics.jsonl` so the spans are **searchable** in Tempo, but those old-timestamp spans do **not** retroactively fill the metric trend panels — the local processor only buckets live ingestion. The metric panels therefore start empty and build up from the point you wire the exporter and run real delegations. Grafana Cloud's hosted Tempo computes historical metrics differently, which is why its runbook describes backfill as seeding the dashboards; locally, backfill seeds trace search only.

In short: the per-recipe / per-tier / calibration trend panels fill in over the following day or two of real use; the trace-search view is available for the whole history immediately after a backfill.

## Dashboards went blank after the machine slept

Single-binary Loki runs its own hash ring, and when the workstation sleeps and wakes the instance's heartbeat goes stale; the ring marks its sole member unhealthy (`at least 1 healthy replica required, could only find 0 ... auto-forgetting instance 127.0.0.1:9096 from the ring`) and refuses queries until it re-forgets the dead member. While the ring has zero healthy members the query path is down, so the Grafana dashboards — which read history from Loki — show nothing, even though Tempo and live trace search are unaffected (the trace path does not touch Loki's ring). It self-heals once the auto-forget period of roughly ten minutes elapses and the instance rejoins.

To confirm the diagnosis and, if you don't want to wait out the auto-forget, force a clean rejoin, run the doctor. Without `--fix` it is read-only — it reports the stack state, Loki readiness, the ring log signature, and how the newest data in Loki compares with the newest row in `metrics.jsonl`:

```bash
bash scripts/observability-doctor.sh          # read-only diagnosis
bash scripts/observability-doctor.sh --fix    # restart Loki + re-run the sync
```

The `--fix` path runs `docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml restart loki`, waits for Loki to report ready again, and re-runs `scripts/sync-metrics-to-loki.sh` to backfill anything the watermark had not yet pushed.

A blank "last 1 hour" panel does not always mean the ring flapped — it may simply mean there were no delegations in that window. The doctor distinguishes the two by judging recency against the metrics file rather than against Loki: if `metrics.jsonl` itself has nothing recent, the empty panel is genuine idleness and nothing is wrong, so the doctor reports `idle` and leaves the stack alone. Only when the file has fresh rows but Loki lags behind them, or Loki's `/ready` returns 503, does it report a recoverable flap (exit 1) worth fixing. The Loki config is deliberately left unhardened here: a single-binary ring on an unbounded host sleep cannot be configured away (there is no quorum to fall back on, so one unhealthy member is zero healthy members by design), which is why the doctor script, not a config knob, is the pragmatic fix.

Freshness cannot see history that is stored twice, so the doctor also counts rows. It reads the sync's watermark file (`metrics.loki-sync` beside the JSONL unless `DELEGATE_LOKI_STATE` or `--state-file` names another, resolved as the sync resolves it), counts the distinct well-formed rows with a valid `ts` in the lines the sync has shipped, and compares that with a `count_over_time` instant query over Loki; the two numbers appear in the summary as `loki_rows` and `shipped_rows`. A mismatch is reported as `cardinality-mismatch` (exit 1) whether or not the file is idle. More rows in Loki than were shipped is the orphaned-history failure, where a change to the sync's timestamp scheme leaves every earlier row stored under both keys, and the doctor prints the wipe-and-resync recovery, because `--fix` and `--full` only ever add rows. Fewer rows means Loki lost data the watermark says was pushed, and `sync-metrics-to-loki.sh --full` restores it. The check is skipped (`n/a`) while Loki's query path is down, before the sync has ever run against the file, or when Loki returns no count, and a sync running at the same moment can produce a one-off mismatch, so re-run before acting on one.

## Backfill historical traces (optional, for trace search)

```bash
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh                       # post every pre-exporter row
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh --since 2026-05-01T00:00:00Z  # only since a date
bash scripts/backfill-otel.sh --dry-run             # preview without POSTing
```

Row-level idempotent: rows already exported live (carrying `otel_trace_id`) are skipped, and pre-exporter rows get deterministic IDs so re-running produces no duplicate traces. This populates Tempo's trace search; see the section above for why it does not fill the metric panels.

## Tear down

```bash
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml down       # keep data
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml down -v    # also wipe the volumes
```
