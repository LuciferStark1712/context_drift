# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to look. This repo is one Claude Code skill, two bash scripts of routing logic, and a validation pipeline. There is no build and no package manager; the one linter is ShellCheck, run as `shellcheck -S error` in CI. The runtime is `bash` (3.2+ — macOS-shipped is fine), `jq`, `awk`, `perl`, and `curl` (used by `scripts/delegate.sh` against the backend HTTP API and by both scoring modes of the trigger eval — `--api` and `--local`).

## What lives where

`SKILL.md` is the prompt Claude reads to decide whether to invoke the skill. Its frontmatter `description` field is load-bearing: changes to it directly affect trigger accuracy across every conversation that has the skill installed. Treat `SKILL.md` as production prompt content, not documentation.

`scripts/pick-model.sh` is the single source of truth for tier-to-model routing. Each tier (`code`, `prose`, `reasoning`, `long-context`, plus the scaffolded `vision`, `embedding`, `premium-general`, `reasoning-vision`) holds a substring-matched preference list, highest capability first. When the installed model set changes, edit the `prefs` arrays in this script — never hardcode model names in `SKILL.md` or in shell pipes.

`scripts/delegate.sh` wraps `pick-model.sh` plus the backend's HTTP completions API and appends one JSON line per call to `~/.local/share/delegate-local/metrics.jsonl`. Every call goes to `POST {base}/chat/completions` on the first provider in `DELEGATE_BASE_URL` that is reachable and serving a model the tier prefers; the list defaults to MLX, Docker Model Runner and Ollama on their standard ports, built from `MLX_HOST` / `DOCKER_MODEL_HOST` / `OLLAMA_HOST`. `scripts/audit-models.sh` is read-only and never pulls; it cross-checks `llmfit recommend --json` against the models the reachable providers serve. `scripts/metrics-summary.sh` is the read-only rollup over the metrics JSONL.

`prompts/` is the calibrated-recipe library — each `prompts/<task>.md` ships a proven prompt skeleton with anti-hallucination guards drawn from real session feedback. To add a recipe (or graduate a recurring delegation pattern into one), follow the flow documented in [`prompts/README.md`](prompts/README.md); `tests/test-prompts-library.sh` enforces the required structure.

`docs/adr/` records the load-bearing design decisions; read them before proposing changes that contradict one. The ADRs whose features were archived in the 2026-06-19 lean-core reset carry a note pointing at the `pre-cleanup-2026-06-19` tag.

`ROADMAP.md` is the authoritative project plan: what the skill is, where it stands after the 2026-06-19 lean-core reset, and the priority-ordered next steps. Consult it before starting non-trivial work.

## Running the validation pipeline

The same gates CI runs on every PR are runnable locally. The two frontmatter / content validators plus the unit suite cover most edits:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-frontmatter.sh SKILL.md
bash scripts/validate-skill-content.sh SKILL.md
bash scripts/eval-skill-triggers.sh   # shape check (no model call)
bash tests/run-tests.sh
```

Each kept script has its own per-script test file under `tests/` (`test-delegate.sh`, `test-delegate-feedback.sh`, `test-metrics-summary.sh`, `test-prompts-library.sh`, `test-eval-skill-triggers.sh`, `test-onboard.sh`, `test-project-name.sh`, and the two validator tests). The authoritative list of gates is [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml), which runs every `tests/test-*.sh` file it finds — run the one that matches the script you touched, and run the full set before opening the PR to match CI.

If you edit the `description` field in `SKILL.md` frontmatter, run the trigger eval against a real model before opening the PR:

```bash
bash scripts/eval-skill-triggers.sh --local
```

This is free, runs locally in 10–30 seconds, and dogfoods the project's own routing. CI runs the same gate against the Anthropic API (`--api`) on any PR that changes `SKILL.md` or `evals/`, so a regression there will fail the build. The threshold is recall ≥ 0.9 and negative-precision ≥ 0.9 against `evals/eval-set.json`.

A post-edit hook at `.claude/hooks/post-edit-validate.sh` runs the frontmatter and content checks automatically when you save through Claude Code. It does not run the trigger-accuracy gate — run that yourself before merge.

The `URL_EXTERNAL` content check applies to `SKILL.md` only; contributor docs under `prompts/` may cite external sources (papers, third-party libraries) as evidence of design decisions without going through the allowlist.

## Commits and PRs

Conventional-commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`) are required by the release-please pipeline that drives versioning and CHANGELOG generation. Keep commit and PR messages concise. Reference an issue or roadmap item when the change is non-trivial.

PRs run frontmatter validation, the content scan, `shellcheck -S error`, the unit suite, and, when `SKILL.md` or `evals/` changed, the trigger eval against the Anthropic API. All must pass. The trigger eval needs the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret; without it the step prints a notice and skips.

## Releasing

Releases are cut by release-please. Merging to `main` opens or updates a PR titled `chore(main): release X.Y.Z`; merging that PR tags the commit and publishes the release.

Two independent quirks of this repository are worth knowing before cutting one.

Releases publish rather than draft. `release-please-config.json` sets `"draft": false` deliberately. A draft GitHub release does not create its git tag, and release-please anchors changelog generation on tags, so a drafted release silently breaks the *next* one: with no tag to anchor on it regenerates the whole history into the following changelog. That is what happened to v0.21.0 through v0.23.0, whose release PRs all merged normally but left no tags behind, and it is why the 0.24.0 PR was first generated with 314 changelog entries instead of six. Do not set this flag back to `true`.

While the `RELEASE_APP_ID` variable is unset (the `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback described below), the release PR's CI needs a manual approval. It is authored by `github-actions[bot]`, and the repository's Actions approval policy is `first_time_contributors`, so every workflow run on the release branch completes as `action_required` with zero jobs until someone approves it. Because the runs hold with no jobs, they publish no check runs at all, and `validate skill` — the one required status check on `main` — can never report, so the PR sits `BLOCKED` with `mergeable: MERGEABLE`.

On that fallback path, approve the runs; do not reach for `--admin`. With the App token in place neither is needed. Approving makes the gate actually run, whereas `--admin` merges around a gate that never reported (`enforce_admins` is `false` on `main`). From the CLI:

```bash
sha=$(gh api repos/IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local/pulls/<n> --jq .head.sha)
# `action_required` is a valid value for BOTH status and conclusion in the
# Actions API. A run held for approval was observed as status=completed,
# conclusion=action_required on 2026-08-28; match either so the recipe does
# not depend on which phase the run is caught in.
gh run list --branch release-please--branches--main --limit 8 \
  --json databaseId,headSha,status,conclusion \
  --jq '.[] | select(.headSha=="'"$sha"'"
        and (.status=="action_required" or .conclusion=="action_required")) | .databaseId'
gh api repos/IsmaelMartinez/delegate-local/actions/runs/<run-id>/approve -X POST
```

0.32.0 was released this way on 2026-08-28 and merged with a plain `gh pr merge 463 --squash --delete-branch`. This is unrelated to the draft flag above: it delays a release rather than corrupting the next one. Removing the approval step entirely means either loosening the Actions approval policy — a security trade-off on a public repo — or giving release-please a PAT or GitHub App token so its PR is not bot-authored. The App token was chosen (#549): `release-please.yml` mints one with `actions/create-github-app-token` whenever the repository variable `RELEASE_APP_ID` and secret `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` are set, and falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` (and so to the approval step above) while they are not. The App needs no webhook and three repository permissions, all Read and write: Contents (tags, releases, the release branch), Pull requests (the release PR) and Issues (the `autorelease: pending` and `autorelease: tagged` labels, set through the issues API). Install it on this repository only, and put its private key (.pem) in the secret.

If a release PR is stale, re-run the `Release Please` workflow from the Actions tab; it has a `workflow_dispatch` trigger for exactly this, so there is no need to push a no-op commit to `main`.

## Labels

One project-specific issue label you may encounter: `prompt-pattern` marks an issue that captures a recurring delegation MISS — a task shape the local model keeps getting wrong — so the maintainer can graduate it into a calibrated `prompts/<task>.md` recipe (the `delegate-feedback.sh` nudge drafts these; see the README "Calibration feedback loop").

## Cross-platform constraints

This skill runs on the macOS-shipped bash 3.2 and the GNU bash that most Linux distributions ship. Two things to avoid:

```bash
# Avoid: associative arrays (bash 4-only — breaks on macOS)
declare -A foo

# Avoid: grep -P (GNU-only — breaks on macOS BSD grep)
grep -P '\d+' file
```

Use newline-delimited allowlists keyed by either path-and-line or sha256, and use `perl -CSD` for unicode-aware regex. The validation scripts already follow this pattern; match their style when adding new ones.

## Scope

The "out of scope" section of `ROADMAP.md` is binding. The discriminator is the local-brain insight: local models are strong summarisers and weak agents. If a task needs multi-step reasoning, repo-wide context, or tool-calling, it does not belong in this skill even if the surface looks textual. A general-purpose router, an auto-pulling installer, and code-edit / refactor delegation are all explicitly out of scope.

## Where to start

The roadmap's "Where we're going" section lists the priority-ordered next steps. Anything beyond it needs a concrete trigger — re-introducing an archived capability should be driven by a real consumer asking for it, not by default.

For first-time contributors, the lowest-friction starting points are: refining a tier's preference list in `pick-model.sh` (with a corresponding test in `tests/run-tests.sh`), adding or tightening a recipe in `prompts/` (with `tests/test-prompts-library.sh` enforcing the shape), or adding an issue category to `scripts/validate-skill-content.sh` with a test fixture. ADR `docs/adr/0003-tier-preference-lists.md` covers the rationale for the routing shape if you want to read before editing.
